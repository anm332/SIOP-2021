Terrorist,ISIS,1,1,1,Middle East,2014,2,Khalid An-Najdi,Follower,,"I was born in the Arabian Peninsula. I was also a student in the United Kingdom for some time. I decided to write this short message before I do a martyrdom operation. To our brothers in Isl_m who are in the kuf_r countries (America, France, United Kingdom … etc.): You defnitely know what is happening to the Isl_mic ummah and Muslims all over the world. The kuf_r are killing our brothers and raping our sisters while we stand by and do nothing to prevent it, the exact opposite of what Isl_m teaches us. The frst thing I say to Muslims in America and the European countries is that you are in the heart of nations of the kuf_r. You are in a place that too many Mujahedeen wish they were in, so that they can beat the kuf_r in their own countries, destroy their peace as they destroy ours; force them to stop the war against Muslims. And force them to leave the Arabian Peninsula as well as all other Muslim countries, move the war from our lands to theirs and keep fighting them until we let Isl_m rule the whole planet. Being in the heart of the nations of kuf_r is a chance All_h has given you to punish the kuf_r in their own territory. So do not do like I did and leave without doing anything. The second thing is that when you make a small operation in America or European countries you gain more results than a huge operation outside their home. ... And remember that Jih_d is not dependent on a specific person and you are not being asked about what others have done to defend Muslims from the brutish attack on Isl_m. ... All_h will ask you alone about what you did for Isl_m. So do not hesitate or even think twice, all you need is just to follow the steps that the Mujahedeen give you in 'Inspire Magazine' and ask All_h to make it easy for you.

Terrorist,Al-Qaeda,1,1,1,Middle East,2010,2,Shaykh Abu Basir,Leader,Head of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula,"""All praise is due to All_h, the Lord of the Worlds. Jih_d is an obligation from All_h__ _____ . Young Muslims are brought up into it since the day the Messenger of All_h ___ ____ ____ ____ carried the sword until the last of this nation will fight against the False Messiah. Jih_d will continue throughout the generations of Muslims.The organization of al-Q_`idah is among these generations of Muslims who are carrying the responsibility of calling to Isl_m and defending the holy sites, the religion, honor and land since its foundation before three decades. Since 1990 when the Americans occupied the land of revelation, the youth of the Peninsula of Isl_m are defending their religion, their holy places and their land which their Messenger, peace be upon him, ordered to expel from it the disbelievers. They have executed a few operations against the Americans in and out of the Arabian Peninsula. The most famous are the Ulaya, al-Khobar, East Riyadh, USS Cole, Limburg, and the assassination of US soldiers in the island of Faylakah in Kuwait. The leaders of al-Q_`idah such as Shaykh al-Batt_r Y_suf al- `Uya_r_, `Abdul `Az_z al-Miqrin, and Shaykh Ab_ `Al_ al-__rith_ and others led this war against the Americans in and outside of the Arabian Peninsula. We are proud with this legacy not only as Muslims but as freemen too. The organization of AQAP, as our beloved leader Shaykh Us_mah said: “With America entering into con$ict with the sons of the land of the two holy places, it will forget the terrors of Vietnam. And, by the will of All_h, the upcoming victory in the land of _ij_z and Najd will make America forget the horrors of Vietnam and Beirut, by the permission of All_h, Glorified and Exalted be He.” Our objectives are driving out the occupiers from the Arabian Peninsula and purifying its land from them, establishing the law of shar_`ah, the establishment of khil_fah, spreading the call to the oneness of All_h __ _____ ,defending against the transgressors and helping the weak. All praise is due to All_h, the Lord of the Worlds, All_h __ _____ has blessed us with e""""ective operations against the transgressing Americans and we ask All_h to grant us more. The interest that is shown towards AQAP is because of the strategic importance of the Arabian Peninsula. This is the place of the revelation, the birthplace of Isl_m, the land of the two holy Mosques and the blood of the sa__ba runs through the veins of its sons. Because of the greed of the Americans, they have vital interests in the Arabian Peninsula. The passageways of commerce pass through its waters and oil is stolen from it. So this place is a vein of life for the Americans. Thus they are focused on it and they do not want any con$icts in this area or any group that would protect the wealth of the Muslims and their religion. They fear that their plots would be foiled and their dreams brought to an end. To answer your question on how serious the danger of AQAP is, I say that wherever there are muj_hid_n, there is danger awaiting the disbelievers. The muj_hid_n are one body and if one of them is somewhere you would find fear and terror spreading in that place. All of the branches of al-Q_`idah have succeeded in powerful operations against the Americans and the latest is the car bomb in New York. The di""""erent branches have good competition in fighting the Americans and their allies. All of them want to win the race of destroying the idol (i.e. , America) and to have the greatest share in that effort. All praise is due to All_h, the targeting of Mu_ammad bin Nayif was part of our e""""ort to purify the Arabian Peninsula from the traitors. He and his ilk are the ones who allowed the Americans to set base in the Peninsula of Isl_m, playing the role of Ab_ Ruq_l in its worst forms. He is an American in the clothes of an Arab. If it wasn’t for these traitors, the American airplanes wouldn’t have bombed Iraq and Afghanistan from the airports of Kharj and Riyadh and others, and if wasn’t for them, the Jews wouldn’t have remained in Palestine for more than sixty years. So this evil deformed person who is leading the war against the muj_hid_n, who is plotting against them day and night, and is implementing the American agenda, has led us to target him because of his actions. Some of the results of this blessed operation are that it turned the attention of the muj_hid_n to target the leaders of disbelief and the plotters of evil and that reaching them is not di&cult by the will of All_h. This operation broke the legend of the infallibility of their security measures and made it clear that the heroic muj_hid - by properly concealing his device, not having any metal parts in it and putting his trust in All_h __ _____ - can reach to his target without being exposed. All praise is due to All_h, the operation of `Umar al-F_r_q – may All_h hasten his release – is a strong blow to the con of the Because of the greed of the Americans, they have vital interests in the Arabian Peninsula. The passageways of commerce pass through its waters and oil is stolen from it. So this place is a vein of life for the Americans. American economy and is a slap in the face of the American security apparatus. He reached his destination and was able to break through all of the strict security barriers after passing through a few airports and was searched in them. But through the blessing of All_h __ _____ ,all security equipment failed to display his explosive device. The message we intended on sending to the Americans is: “America will never enjoy security until we live it in Palestine and it is not fair for you to enjoy life while our brothers in Gaza are going through a difficult life.” The fruits of the operation are many. Some of which: t Great loss to the US economy which reached $41 billion and all of their security measures have gone with the wind. The fear which has spread throughout airports and security institutions has revealed to the American people that its security institutions are not to be counted upon. Delivering fear to the American people and creating a balance in fear and that security is not something that the government of Obama can control. Opening the door for many Muslim youth in the West who want to seek revenge from the Crusader states that are fighting Isl_m. What we want from the West is one thing: To stop aggression and oppression against the Muslim Nation and to withdraw out of its land. This solution was given by all of our leaders and in more than one occasion. The truce was offered by the one who has real authority to take such a decision on behalf of the Muslims, Shaykh Us_mah bin L_din, may All_h preserve him. His o""""er was refused. Whenever we o""""er a sound plan, they escalate in their stubbornness so we are left with no option but to defend ourselves and fight the transgressors. If the West refrains from attacking us and oppressing our Nation, we will refrain from them. Otherwise we will have them drink from the same cup that they have the innocent from our Nation drink from. The American culture is that of killing other people. How many have the Americans killed from the Vietnamese, the Japanese, the Iraqi people, the Afghani people, and the Somali people, and how many have the Zionist allies killed from the sons of Palestine with the support of these bloodthirsty beasts? And finally they have killed tens from the tribe of B_k_zim, Ar_ab and al-`Aw_liq. They have killed women and children and lied by saying that these were preemptive strikes against al-Q_`idah in order to justify to their people that they have killed the leaders of al-Q_`idah. The Yemeni government jumped not to defend its sovereignty and its innocent people but to condemn the oppressed and justify for the Americans their crimes. They marketed the American bombing as a bombing performed by their air force against al-Q_`idah when they knew that the casualties were Bedouins. But it seems as if the Yemeni government has settled some previous scores while the women and children pay the price at the hand of the Americans. And what are these accurate operations that have killed tens of children and women? If the pilot was ignorant of military matters he would still be able to tell the di""""erence between tents of bedouins and military sites, but it is American hate and lust for killing others. These bombings will not deliver anything to the Americans and will not weaken the organization by the blessings of All_h. Instead they will only advance us further and push the Muslim people to stand with us. These reckless acts of the Americans will only reveal to the Muslim people the reality of the democracy of murder and destruction. The president of Yemen is a professional liar, especially when it comes to lying in order to extort money. Such lies bring in dollars from the Americans. They are gullible and he is creating for them fake victories. As the caller to Isl_m, Shaykh Anwar al-`Awlak_, may All_h preserve him, said: “The distinctive mark of the Yemeni government is lying. They are lying to their people. They are lying to the outside world. They are lying to everyone.” They have been lying for thirty years. They lie against their people in an exposed fashion and this proves to us their inability to defend themselves let alone others and that the matter is out of their hands now. Thus, they have nothing else to do but lie and claim that we have killed so-and-so and imprisoned so-and-so. This is all in order that foreign assistance keeps flowing in. All praise is due to All_h. America is the one forcing us to target it. These heinous crimes which the human soul rejects such as the cartoons of the Messenger ___ ____ ____ ____ and holding celebrations and awarding those who curse the Prophet ___ ____ ____ ____ require us to target the Americans. In fact they require us to wipe them out of the map completely. America is a cancer that needs to be removed along with the West that is supporting this criminal behavior and are banning the niq_b of the chaste and pure Muslim women. Thus, we insist on fighting against this oppression and aggression. The issue now is not fighting for peoples’ lives, land or wealth as the obligation has become greater than that. The issue now is the defense of the Prophets and supporting them against these obscene people. For them there is no way out from the punishment of All_h because All_h __ _____ will protect His Messengers. All_h __ _____ protects the believers so wouldn’t he protect His Prophets who are the most beloved to Him and are the chosen ones of His creation? All_h __ _____ will give us victory against them and what America awaits in the coming days is greater and worse than what has passed by the will of All_h: All_h __ _____ says: (Say: “Do you await for us except one of the two best things [i.e., martyrdom or victory] while we await for you that All_h will a(ict you with punishment from Himself or at our hands? So wait; indeed we, along with you, are waiting). My advice to my Muslim brothers in the West is to acquire weapons and learn methods of war. They are living in a place where they can cause great harm to the enemy and where they can support the Messenger of All_h ___ ____ ____ ____ There is no meaning in life if the Messenger of All_h ___ ____ ____ ____ is cursed while they listen to and see such crimes being committed in front of their eyes. It is not enough to defend him, may my father and mother be sacrificed for him, to participate in demonstrations and protests because these methods would not stop the West which is already used to them. The successful means are through explosive devices and sacrificing souls. That is a more pronounced and successful way of defending him and this is a practice started by the __lib_n of Pakistan, Ni__l _assan, and `Umar al-F_r_q, may All_h release them and on this path are men who are coming to you by the will of All_h. O Muslims rise up in defense of your Messenger ___ ____ ____ ____ :a man with his knife, a man with his gun, a man with his rifle, a man with his bomb, by learning how to design explosive devices, by burning down forests and buildings, or by running over them with your cars and trucks.

Terrorist,Al-Qaeda,1,1,1,Middle East,1998,2,Usama Bin Laden,Leader,Founder of Al Qaeda. Interview with PBS Frontline.,"The call to wage war against America was made because America has spearheaded the crusade against the Islamic nation, sending tens of thousands of its troops to the land of the two Holy Mosques over and above its meddling in its affairs and its politics, and its support of the oppressive, corrupt and tyrannical regime that is in control. These are the reasons behind the singling out of America as a target. And not exempt of responsibility are those Western regimes whose presence in the region offers support to the American troops there. We know at least one reason behind the symbolic participation of the Western forces and that is to support the Jewish and Zionist plans for expansion of what is called the Great Israel. Surely, their presence is not out of concern over their interests in the region. ... Their presence has no meaning save one and that is to offer support to the Jews in Palestine who are in need of their Christian brothers to achieve full control over the Arab Peninsula which they intend to make an important part of the so called Greater Israel. There is an Arabic proverb that says ""she accused me of having her malady, then snuck away."" Besides, terrorism can be commendable and it can be reprehensible. Terrifying an innocent person and terrorizing him is objectionable and unjust, also unjustly terrorizing people is not right. Whereas, terrorizing oppressors and criminals and thieves and robbers is necessary for the safety of people and for the protection of their property. There is no doubt in this. Every state and every civilization and culture has to resort to terrorism under certain circumstances for the purpose of abolishing tyranny and corruption. Every country in the world has its own security system and its own security forces, its own police and its own army. They are all designed to terrorize whoever even contemplates to attack that country or its citizens. The terrorism we practice is of the commendable kind for it is directed at the tyrants and the aggressors and the enemies of Allah, the tyrants, the traitors who commit acts of treason against their own countries and their own faith and their own prophet and their own nation. Terrorizing those and punishing them are necessary measures to straighten things and to make them right. Tyrants and oppressors who subject the Arab nation to aggression ought to be punished. The wrongs and the crimes committed against the Muslim nation are far greater than can be covered by this interview. America heads the list of aggressors against Muslims. The recurrence of aggression against Muslims everywhere is proof enough. For over half a century, Muslims in Palestine have been slaughtered and assaulted and robbed of their honor and of their property. Their houses have been blasted, their crops destroyed. And the strange thing is that any act on their part to avenge themselves or to lift the injustice befalling them causes great agitation in the United Nations which hastens to call for an emergency meeting only to convict the victim and to censure the wronged and the tyrannized whose children have been killed and whose crops have been destroyed and whose farms have been pulverized. ...
In today's wars, there are no morals, and it is clear that mankind has descended to the lowest degrees of decadence and oppression. They rip us of our wealth and of our resources and of our oil. Our religion is under attack. They kill and murder our brothers. They compromise our honor and our dignity and dare we utter a single word of protest against the injustice, we are called terrorists. This is compounded injustice. And the United Nations insistence to convict the victims and support the aggressors constitutes a serious precedence which shows the extent of injustice that has been allowed to take root in this land. ...
Cooperation for the sake of truth and righteousness is demanded from Muslims. A Muslim should do his utmost to cooperate with his fellow Muslims. But Allah says of cooperation that it is not absolute for there is cooperation to do good, and there is cooperation to commit aggression and act unjustly. A Muslim is supposed to give his fellow Muslim guidance and support. He (Allah) said ""Stand by your brother be he oppressor or oppressed."" When asked how were they to stand by him if he were the oppressor, He answered them, saying ""by giving him guidance and counsel."" It all goes to say that Muslims should cooperate with one another and should be supportive of one another, and they should promote righteousness and mercy. They should all unite in the fight against polytheism and they should pool all their resources and their energy to fight the Americans and the Zionists and those with them. They should, however, avoid side fronts and rise over the small problems for these are less detrimental. Their fight should be directed against unbelief and unbelievers. ...As we have already said, our call is the call of Islam that was revealed to Mohammed. It is a call to all mankind. We have been entrusted with good cause to follow in the footsteps of the Messenger and to communicate his message to all nations. It is an invitation that we extend to all the nations to embrace Islam, the religion that calls for justice, mercy and fraternity among all nations, not differentiating between black and white or between red and yellow except with respect to their devotedness. All people who worship Allah, not each other, are equal before Him. We are entrusted to spread this message and to extend that call to all the people. We, nonetheless, fight against their governments and all those who approve of the injustice they practice against us. We fight the governments that are bent on attacking our religion and on stealing our wealth and on hurting our feelings. And as I have mentioned before, we fight them, and those who are part of their rule are judged in the same manner. ..Praise be Allah and prayers and peace upon Mohammed. With respect to the Western governments that participated in the attack on the land of the two Holy Mosques regarding it as ownerless, and in the siege against the Muslim people of Iraq, we have nothing new to add to the previous message. What prompted us to address the American government in particular is the fact that it is on the head of the Western and the crusading forces in their fight against Islam and against Muslims. The two explosions that took place in Riyadh and in Khobar recently were but a clear and powerful signal to the governments of the countries which willingly participated in the aggression against our countries and our lives and our sacrosanct symbols. It might be beneficial to mention that some of those countries have begun to move towards independence from the American government with respect to the enmity that it continues to show towards the Muslim people. We only hope that they will continue to move in that direction, away from the oppressive forces that are fighting against our countries. We however, differentiate between the western government and the people of the West. If the people have elected those governments in the latest elections, it is because they have fallen prey to the Western media which portray things contrary to what they really are. And while the slogans raised by those regimes call for humanity, justice, and peace, the behavior of their governments is completely the opposite. It is not enough for their people to show pain when they see our children being killed in Israeli raids launched by American planes, nor does this serve the purpose. What they ought to do is change their governments which attack our countries. The hostility that America continues to express against the Muslim people has given rise to feelings of animosity on the part of Muslims against America and against the West in general. Those feelings of animosity have produced a change in the behavior of some crushed and subdued groups who, instead of fighting the Americans inside the Muslim countries, went on to fight them inside the United States of America itself. 
The Western regimes and the government of the United States of America bear the blame for what might happen. If their people do not wish to be harmed inside their very own countries, they should seek to elect governments that are truly representative of them and that can protect their interests. ...
The enmity between us and the Jews goes far back in time and is deep rooted. There is no question that war between the two of us is inevitable. For this reason it is not in the interest of Western governments to expose the interests of their people to all kinds of retaliation for almost nothing. It is hoped that people of those countries will initiate a positive move and force their governments not to act on behalf of other states and other sects. This is what we have to say and we pray to Allah to preserve the nation of Islam and to help them drive their enemies out of their land.
The leaders in America and in other countries as well have fallen victim to Jewish Zionist blackmail. They have mobilized their people against Islam and against Muslims. These are portrayed in such a manner as to drive people to rally against them. The truth is that the whole Muslim world is the victim of international terrorism, engineered by America at the United Nations. We are a nation whose sacred symbols have been looted and whose wealth and resources have been plundered. It is normal for us to react against the forces that invade our land and occupy it ... .Tell the Muslims everywhere that the vanguards of the warriors who are fighting the enemies of Islam belong to them and the young fighters are their sons. Tell them that the nation is bent on fighting the enemies of Islam. Once again, I have to stress the necessity of focusing on the Americans and the Jews for they represent the spearhead with which the members of our religion have been slaughtered. Any effort directed against America and the Jews yields positive and direct results - Allah willing. It is far better for anyone to kill a single American soldier than to squander his efforts on other activities. … This is difficult to understand, especially for him who does not understand the religion of Islam. In our religion, we believe that Allah has created us for the purpose of worshipping him. He is the one who has created us and who has favored us with this religion. Allah has ordered us to make holy wars and to fight to see to it that His word is the highest and the uppermost and that of the unbelievers the lowermost. We believe that this is the call we have to answer regardless of our financial capabilities. This too answers the claims of the West and of the secular people in the Arab world. They claim that this blessed awakening and the people reverting to Islam are due to economic factors. This is not so. It is rather a grace from Allah, a desire to embrace the religion of Allah. And this is not surprising. When the holy war called, thousands of young men from the Arab Peninsula and other countries answered the call and they came from wealthy backgrounds. Hundreds of them were killed in Afghanistan and in Bosnia and in ChechnyaWe do not care what the Americans believe. What we care for is to please Allah. Americans heap accusations on whoever stands for his religion or his rights or his wealth. ... It does not scare us that they have put a price on my head. We as Muslims believe that our years on this earth are finite and predetermined. If the whole world gets together to kill us before it is our time to go, they will not succeed. We also believe that livelihoods are preordained. So no matter how much pressure American puts on the regime in Riyadh to freeze our assets and to forbid people from contributing to this great cause, we shall still have Allah to take care of us; livelihood is sent by Allah; we shall not want. ...Allah has ordered us to glorify the truth and to defend Muslim land, especially the Arab peninsula ... against the unbelievers. After World War II, the Americans grew more unfair and more oppressive towards people in general and Muslims in particular. ... The Americans started it and retaliation and punishment should be carried out following the principle of reciprocity, especially when women and children are involved. Through history, American has not been known to differentiate between the military and the civilians or between men and women or adults and children. Those who threw atomic bombs and used the weapons of mass destruction against Nagasaki and Hiroshima were the Americans. Can the bombs differentiate between military and women and infants and children? America has no religion that can deter her from exterminating whole peoples. Your position against Muslims in Palestine is despicable and disgraceful. America has no shame. ... We believe that the worst thieves in the world today and the worst terrorists are the Americans. Nothing could stop you except perhaps retaliation in kind. We do not have to differentiate between military or civilian. As far as we are concerned, they are all targets, and this is what the fatwah says ... . The fatwah is general (comprehensive) and it includes all those who participate in, or help the Jewish occupiers in killing Muslims. After the explosion that took place in the World Trade Center, Ramzi Yousef became a well known Muslim figure. Muslims have come to know him. Unfortunately, I did not know him before this incident. I of course remember who he is. He is a Muslim who wanted to protect his religion jealously from the oppression practiced by America against Islam. He acted with zeal to make the Americans understand that their government was attacking Muslims in order to safeguard the American-Jewish interests. ...Wali Khan is a Muslim young man; his nickname in Afghanistan was the Lion. He was among the most courageous Muslim young men. He was a close friend and we used to fight from the same trenches in Afghanistan. We fought many battles against the Russians until they were defeated and put to shame and had to leave the country in disgrace. As to what you said about him working for me, I have nothing to say. We are all together in this; we all work for Allah and our reward comes from him. As to what you said about the attempt to assassinate President Clinton, it is not surprising. What do you expect from people attacked by Clinton, whose sons and mothers have been killed by Clinton? Do you expect anything but treatment by reciprocity? We have roused the nation and the Muslim people and we have communicated to them the fatwahs of our learned scholars who the Saudi government has thrown in jail in order to please the American government for which they are agents. ... We have communicated their fatwahs and stirred the nation to drive out the enemy who has occupied our land and usurped our country and suppressed our people and to rid the land of the two Holy Mosques from their presence. Among the young men who responded to our call are Khalid Al Said and Abdul Azeez Al... and Mahmud Al Hadi and Muslih Al Shamrani. We hope Allah receives them as holy martyrs. They have raised the nation's head high and washed away a great part of the shame that has enveloped us as a result of the weakness of the Saudi government and its complicity with the American government ... . Yes, we have instigated and they have responded. We hope Allah grants their families solace. As I have said, we are not interested in what America says. We do not care. We view ourselves and our brothers like everyone else. Allah created us to worship Him and to follow in his footsteps and to be guided by His Book. I am one of the servants of Allah and I obey his orders. Among those is the order to fight for the word of Allah ... and to fight until the Americans are driven out of all the Islamic countries.... Allah has granted the Muslim people and the Afghani mujahedeen, and those with them, the opportunity to fight the Russians and the Soviet Union. ... They were defeated by Allah and were wiped out. There is a lesson here. The Soviet Union entered Afghanistan late in December of '79. The flag of the Soviet Union was folded once and for all on the 25thof December just 10 years later. It was thrown in the waste basket. Gone was the Soviet union forever. We are certain that we shall - with the grace of Allah - prevail over the Americans and over the Jews, as the Messenger of Allah promised us in an authentic prophetic tradition when He said the Hour of Resurrection shall not come before Muslims fight Jews and before Jews hide behind trees and behind rocks. 
We are certain - with the grace of Allah - that we shall prevail over the Jews and over those fighting with them. Today however, our battle against the Americans is far greater than our battle was against the Russians. Americans have committed unprecedented stupidity. They have attacked Islam and its most significant sacrosanct symbols ... . We anticipate a black future for America. Instead of remaining United States, it shall end up separated states and shall have to carry the bodies of its sons back to America. 
History has the answer to your question. The fate of any government which sells the interests of its own people and, betrays the nation and commits offenses which furnish grounds for expulsion from Islam, is known. We expect for the ruler of Riyadh the same fate as the Shah of Iran. We anticipate this to happen to him and to the influential people who stand by him and who have sided with the Jews and the Christians giving them free reign over the land of the two Holy Mosques. These are grave offenses that are grounds for expulsion from the faith. They shall all be wiped outAfter our victory in Afghanistan and the defeat of the oppressors who had killed millions of Muslims, the legend about the invincibility of the superpowers vanished. Our boys no longer viewed America as a superpower. So, when they left Afghanistan, they went to Somalia and prepared themselves carefully for a long war. They had thought that the Americans were like the Russians, so they trained and prepared. They were stunned when they discovered how low was the morale of the American soldier. America had entered with 30,000 soldiers in addition to thousands of soldiers from different countries in the world. ... As I said, our boys were shocked by the low morale of the American soldier and they realized that the American soldier was just a paper tiger. He was unable to endure the strikes that were dealt to his army, so he fled, and America had to stop all its bragging and all that noise it was making in the press after the Gulf War in which it destroyed the infrastructure and the milk and dairy industry that was vital for the infants and the children and the civilians and blew up dams which were necessary for the crops people grew to feed their families. Proud of this destruction, America assumed the titles of world leader and master of the new world order. After a few blows, it forgot all about those titles and rushed out of Somalia in shame and disgrace, dragging the bodies of its soldiers. America stopped calling itself world leader and master of the new world order, and its politicians realized that those titles were too big for them and that they were unworthy of them. I was in Sudan when this happened. I was very happy to learn of that great defeat that America suffered, so was every MuslimAfter our victory over the Russians in Afghanistan, the international and the American mass media conducted fierce campaigns against us ... . They called us terrorists even before the mujahedeen had committed any act of terrorism against the real terrorists who are the Americans. On the other hand, we say that American politics and their religion do not believe in differentiating between civilians and military, between infants and animals, or among any human groups. ...
Our mothers and daughters and sons are slaughtered every day with the approval of America and its support. And, while America blocks the entry of weapons into Islamic countries, it provides the Israelis with a continuous supply of arms allowing them thus to kill and massacre more Muslims. Your religion does not forbid you from committing such acts, so you have no right to object to any response or retaliation that reciprocates your own actions. But, and in spite of this, our retaliation is directed primarily against the soldiers only and against those standing by them. Our religion forbids us from killing innocent people such as women and children. This, however, does not apply to women fighters. A woman who puts herself in the same trench with men, gets what they get
I say to them that they have put themselves at the mercy of a disloyal government, and this is most evident in Clinton's administration ... . We believe that this administration represents Israel inside America. Take the sensitive ministries such as the Ministry of Exterior and the Ministry of Defense and the CIA, you will find that the Jews have the upper hand in them. They make use of America to further their plans for the world, especially the Islamic world. American presence in the Gulf provides support to the Jews and protects their rear. And while millions of Americans are homeless and destitute and live in abject poverty, their government is busy occupying our land and building new settlements and helping Israel build new settlements in the point of departure for our Prophet's midnight journey to the seven heavens. America throws her own sons in the land of the two Holy Mosques for the sake of protecting Jewish interests. ...
The American government is leading the country towards hell. ... We say to the Americans as people and to American mothers, if they cherish their lives and if they cherish their sons, they must elect an American patriotic government that caters to their interests not the interests of the Jews. If the present injustice continues with the wave of national consciousness, it will inevitably move the battle to American soil, just as Ramzi Yousef and others have done. This is my message to the American people. I urge them to find a serious administration that acts in their interest and does not attack people and violate their honor and pilfer their wealth.
I am one of the servants of Allah. We do our duty of fighting for the sake of the religion of Allah. It is also our duty to send a call to all the people of the world to enjoy this great light and to embrace Islam and experience the happiness in Islam. Our primary mission is nothing but the furthering of this religion. ... Let not the West be taken in by those who say that Muslims choose nothing but slaughtering. Their brothers in East Europe, in Turkey and in Albania have been guided by Allah to submit to Islam and to experience the bliss of Islam. Unlike those, the European and the American people and some of the Arabs are under the influence of Jewish media. ..",4000,3.92,1.03,5.31,,,,,,,,,
Terrorist,Al-Qaeda,1,1,1,Middle East,1994,2,Usama Bin Laden,Leader,Founder of Al Qaeda,"Our relationship with the Ansar al-Sunnah group is like our relationship with the other Islamic groups-a lose, cordial, and good relationship based on brotherhood in God. It is Muslims' duty toward their Muslim brothers. We harbor no hostility toward anyone or any Afghan groups. Our relationship with the Afghan mojahedin egan in 1399 Hijra (1979), namely when we went to Lahore, Pakistan, and worked with the Islamic group in Pakistan to support the mojahedin against the communist invasion. We have focused on helping the brothers in Afghanistan since 1985. We opened camps to train young men to fight the Soviet invasion. We cooperated with everyone to help Muslims to defend themselves and their religion, especially as the enemies of Islam want Muslims to remain weak and subservient. Our work in Afghanistan, which caused some people to insult us, was devoted to fighting the communist invasion and raising the banner that reads ``There is no other god but God.'' There are external quarters at which a finger of accusation could be pointed. They are the quarters spitefully hostile to Islam. They do not accept the natural right of Muslims to defend themselves. Our position in Afghanistan caused some of Islam's enemies o try to obstruct our cooperation with Muslims. The world tends to prefer to overlook the oppression and persecution in Bosnia and occupied Palestine and then hasten to accuse Muslims of terrorism if they defend themselves. It wants to keep Muslims weak and incapable of defending themselves. We also know that there are contacts among diplomats, all resigned to curb our movement and stop our contacts with our brothers. But we say that cooperation in piety is continuing among Muslims. There is a disagreement because of their rejection of our cooperation with the Islamic awakening, support f Muslim issues, and opposition to their restrictions on the all [al-da'wah] and the preachers. I am accused of supporting fundamentalism, even though everyone knows that this stems from our eagerness to raise the banner that reads ``There is no other god but God'' and support the Afghan mojahedin camps to fight oppression and communist aggression. I believe that all Muslims adopted this position; or that is what we believe was the case. The Egyptian press says that Usama Bin Ladin supports fundamentalism. We know that there are domestic problems in Egypt because of the state's violence against Islamists. Obviously there are bound to be reactions to this government policy. Like many other Muslim young men, some Islamists in Egypt gained military experience in the Afghan mojahedin amps. These conditions forced some to take such positions in their countries to defend their religion and themselves. The Egyptians are trying to indicate that I have something to do with the reactions taking place in their country. And hey accuse me of posing a threat to them. What I said about Egypt I say about Yemen, which I believe is one of the best Arab and Muslim countries in terms of adherence to traditions and the faith. Nevertheless, its citizens have been subjected to murder and religious persecution. So it is natural for reactions to take place, even if some of Yemen's sons do train in Afghan camps. The accusation that we support terrorism is a hostile, imperialist method designed to suppress Muslims' determination and paralyze their movement toward one another and toward their religion and faith. I visited Sudan for the first time in 1983, where acquainted myself with its agricultural capabilities and investment opportunities. Four years ago we came here to ooperate and work in the areas of road construction and agriculture. I inherited this type of work from my father, may God have mercy on him. At that time Afghanistan lacked everything. So I and other merchants agreed to help Afghanistan. We sent everything that the state needed. Due to the nature of our work, I and my Iranian friends decided to travel to and to stay in Afghanistan. In the beginning, we supplied the mujahidin camps with all their needs for medicine, food, and weapons. In Pakistan, I got acquainted with three Sudanese, who were members of the National Islamic Front [NIF] led by Hasan al-Turabi. NIF was not in power in Sudan yet. One of the three Sudanese was a young man named al-Tahir, a graduate of the engineering college of Khartoum University. Because he remained jobless for several years, he decided to volunteer for the mujahidin ranks in Afghanistan. AlTahir was very bright and polite. He convinced me to invest my funds in Sudanese projects. The al-Bashir-al-Turabi coup then took place in 1989. At that time, I became well-known among the mujahidin, especially the Arab and Muslim ones. 'Abdallah 'Azzam and two of his sons were killed in a car bomb explosion in Peshawar in October 1989. I felt my life was in danger. With the beginning of the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, we mujahidin felt that there were attempts to liquidate the symbols of `Islamic Jihad,' especially as the information available to us indicated that the Mosad was behind the assassination of Shaykh 'Abdallah 'Azzam, who was a Palestinian. To put it simply, the Bin Ladin Establishment's aid covers 13 countries, including Albania, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Netherlands, Britain, Romania, Russia, Turkey, Lebanon, Iraq, and some Gulf countries which there is no need to mention. This aid, comes in particular from the Human Concern International Society, which was founded in Afghanistan in 1982. It is possible, but I do not live in Sudan now. I keep moving and I do not stay permanently in any country."" He adds: ""In general, Sudan needs me more than I need it. I can assure you that my departure from Sudan will inevitably lead to the collapse of the Sudanese economy. What is happening is a mixture of religion and organized crime. It is God that we thank and it is God whose help and forgiveness we seek and whose name we uphold against our own evil and our wrongdoings. Whoever is guided by God cannot be misled and whoever misleads can find no guidance. I declare that there is no God but Allah and that Muhammad is his subject and messenger. ""O ye who believe, fear God as he should be feared and die not except in a state of Islam,"" ""O mankind, reverence your Guardian-Lord who created you from a single person, created, of like nature, his mate and from them twain scattered (like seeds) countless men and women; reverence God, through whom ye demand your mutual (rights) and (reverence) the wombs (that bore you) for God ever watches over you,"" ""O ye who believe, fear God and (always) say a word directed to the right, that he may make your conduct whole and sound and forgive you your sins. He that obeys God and his apostle has already attained the highest achievement."" [Koranic verses] Thank God who said: ""And reform is my only aim and only God can grant me success. On him I depend and in him I believe."" And thank God who said: ""Ye are the best of peoples evolved for mankind, enjoining what is right, forbidding what is wrong, and believing in God."" [Koranic verses] Prayers and peace be upon his Prophet who said: ""People who see an unjust person and do nothing are about to be punished by God."" You are not unaware of the injustice, repression, and aggression that have befallen Muslims through the alliance of Jews, Christians, and their agents, so much so that Muslims' blood has become the cheapest blood and their money and wealth are plundered by the enemies. Your blood has been spilled in Palestine and Iraq. The image of that dreadful massacre in Qana, Lebanon, is still vivid in one's mind, and so are the massacres in Tajikistan, Burma, Kashmir, Assam, the Philippines, Fatani [as transliterated], Ogaden, Somalia, Eritrea, Chechnya, and Bosnia-Herzegovina where hair-raising and revolting massacres were committed before the eyes of the entire world clearly in accordance with a conspiracy by the United States and its allies who banned arms for the oppressed there under the cover of the unfair United Nations. That alerted Muslims to the fact that they are the main target of the Jewish-crusade alliance aggression, and all the false claims about human rights fell under the blows and massacres committed against Muslims everywhere. The latest aggression was one of the worst catastrophes to befall the Muslims since the death of the Prophet, may God's prayers and blessings be upon him. It was the occupation of the land of the two holy mosques [Saudi Arabia], the cradle of Islam, the scene of the revelation, the source of the message, and the site of the holy Ka'bah, the qiblah [to which Muslims turn in prayer] of all Muslims, by Christian armies of the Americans and their allies. God is the source of all power. In the light of the reality we are going through and the blessed, sweeping awakening in the world at large and in the Islamic world in particular, I meet with you today after a long absence dictated by the unjust crusade campaign led by the United States against the ulema and advocates of Islam to prevent them from instigating the Islamic nation against its enemies, as did their predecessors, may God have mercy on their souls, such as IbnTaymiyah and al-'Izz Ibn-'Abd-al-Salam. And so, this Jewish-crusade alliance killed and detained the symbols of the truthful ulema and upholders of the call—and God is above everyone. It killed the mujahid Shaykh 'Abdallah 'Azzam and detained the mujahid Shaykh Ahmad Yasin in the land from which the Prophet, may God's prayers and blessings be upon him, ascended to heaven, and the mujahid Shaykh 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman in the United States. And, at the behest of the United States, a very large number of ulema, advocates of the call, and youth were arrested in the land of the two holy mosques. Prominent among them are Shaykh Salman al-'Awdah, Shaykh Safar alHawali, and their brother. Help comes from God who is the source of all power. We were affected by that injustice in that we were prevented from addressing Muslims and were pursued in Pakistan, Sudan, and Afghanistan. Hence that long absence, but, thanks be t God, a safe base was found in Khorasan [Afghanistan], on the soil of the Hindu Kush where, thanks be to God, the largest heretic power on earth was destroyed and where the superpower myth vanished in the face of the mujahidin's outcry of Allah Akbar [God is great]. Today, from the same land, from Afghanistan, we seek to end the injustice which has befallen the nation at the hands of the Jewish-crusade alliance, especially after the occupation of the land of the ascension of the Prophet [now Israel], may God's prayers and blessings be upon him, and the violation of the land of the two holy mosques. We beseech God to give us victory, for that is in his hands and he is capable of granting it. Today we begin to talk, work, and discuss ways of rectifying what has befallen the Islamic world in general and the land of the two holy mosques in particular. We want to study the ways which could be used to rectify matters and restore rights to their owners as people have been subjected to grave danger and harm to their religion and their lives, people of all walks of life, civilians, military, security men, employees, merchants, people big and small, school and university students, and unemployed university graduates, in fact hundreds of thousands who constitute a broad sector of the society. The same thing has befallen the people in industry and in agriculture, the cities and villages, and the people in the desert and the rural areas. Everyone is complaining about almost everything. The situation in the land of the two holy mosques is like a gigantic volcano about to erupt and destroy heresy and corruption, whatever their source. The explosions of Riyadh and al-Khubar were only a small indication of that torrential flood resulting from the bitter suffering, repression, coercion, great injustice, disgraceful debauchery, and poverty. People have been greatly preoccupied with matters of their livelihood. Talk of economic decline, high prices, massive debts, and overcrowded prisons is widespread and endless in society. Low-income employees will talk to you about their debts running to tens and hundreds of thousands of riyals. They complain about the massive and continuing drop in the purchasing power of the riyal in comparison with most other major currencies. Major traders and contractors will talk to you about the debts owed to them by the state running to hundreds of millions and even billions of riyals, increasing daily as a result of rates of usury. The state's internal debts to the public have reached more than 340 billion riyals, not to mention the foreign debts. People are wondering: Is ours really the largest oil exporting country? They feel that God is tormenting them because they kept quiet about the regime's injustice and illegitimate actions, especially its failure to have recourse to the Shari'ah, its confiscation of people's legitimate rights, the opening of the land of the two holy mosques to the American occupiers, and the arbitrary jailing of the true ulema, heirs of the Prophets. Good people who specialize in matters of religion, such as propagators of Islam and ulema, as well as experts in earthly matters such as traders, economists, and dignitaries, became alert to that affliction and each group did its best to act quickly to remedy the situation. Everyone agrees that the country is moving towards a deep abyss and a terrible calamity the extent of which only God knows. As one major businessman said, ""the king is leading the country to 60 calamities."" God is the source of all help and power. Many princes share the public's concern and privately voice opposition to what is going on in the country in terms of terror, repression, and corruption. The rivalry between princes overseeing their own personal interests has ruined the country and the regime has destroyed its legitimacy with its own hands through many actions, the most important being: 1. Its suspension of the Islamic Shari'ah laws, replacing them with temporal laws, and its bloody confrontation with the truthful ulema and good youth—and God is above everyone. 2. Its failure to protect the country, opening it to the nation's enemies, the American crusader forces who have become the main cause of all aspects of our plight, especially the economic aspect as a result of the unjustified heavy expenditure on them and as a result of the policies they impose on the country, and particularly the oil policy determining the quantities of oil to be produced and setting the prices which suit their own economic interests ignoring the country's economic interests, and also as a result of the exorbitant arms deals imposed on the regime, to the point that people are wondering what good, then, is the regime? So, each group has made efforts to act quickly and evade the danger. They offered advice secretly and openly, in verse and in prose, singly and in groups, and they sent petition after petition and memorandum after memorandum. They left no stone unturned and there was no influential person they did not include in their reformist moves. In their writings they applied the gentle and lenient method of wisdom and good advice calling for reform and penance for the major wrongdoings and corruption that transgressed the categorical religious limits and the public's legitimate rights. Most regrettably, however, the only response they got from the regime was rejection, disregard, and ridicule. The matter did not stop at the point of just humiliating them but that was followed by greater and greater misdeeds throughout the land of the two holy mosques. Therefore, silence was no longer appropriate and overlooking the facts was no longer acceptable. When the excesses intensified and went beyond the limits of simple wrongdoings and misdeeds to violation of the clear basis of Islam, a group of ulema and religious preachers grew tired of the deafening sound of misguidance and injustice and the suffocating smell of corruption. So signs of rejection appeared and voices were raised calling for reform to remedy the situation and stop the rot. They were joined by hundreds of intellectuals, dignitaries, merchants, and former officials. They submitted petitions and memoranda to the king urging reform. In the Hegira year of 1411 during the Gulf war, a petition signed by about 400 figures was submitted to the king calling for rectification of the situation in the country and for an end to the injustice to the public, but he ignored the advice and ridiculed those who offered it, and the situation got worse. Those who had offered the advice then sent more memoranda and petitions, the most important being the advice memorandum handed to the king in the month of Muharram 1413 Hegira which diagnosed the disease and prescribed the medicine with a sound Shari'ah approach and in a sound scientific way. It dwelt on the major gaps in the regime's philosophy and the main anomalies in the regime's foundations, pointing to the suffering of society's symbols and leaders calling for reform, such as the ulema, religious protagonists, tribal shaykhs, merchants, dignitaries, and university professors, who were marginalized, neutralized, and even pursued and harassed. It also dwelt on the country's laws and regulations and what they allowed and disallowed against God's will. It discussed the state of the media in the country which became means for the advancement of individuals and relatives and for obliterating facts, falsifying the truth, defaming righteous people, and shedding crocodile tears for the nation's causes to mislead people without any serious action and to implement the enemies' plans to corrupt people, draw them away from their religion, and spread sin among the believers. ""Those who love (to see) scandal published and broadcast among the believers will have a grievous penalty in this life and in the hereafter. God knows and ye know not"". It discussed the people's violated legitimate rights and the administrative situation with all its inefficiency and corruption. It pointed to the state's financial and economic situation and the terrible and frightful fate in store as a result of the debts of usury which have broken the state's back, and to the waste which has squandered the nation's wealth to satisfy personal wealth, resulting in taxes, duties, and excises imposed on the public. The Prophet, may God's prayers and blessings be upon him, said about the woman who sinned, repented, and was dealt with accordingly: ""She repented and if one who imposes taxes repented in the same way he would be forgiven."" That reflects the magnitude of the sin of the tax man, but some are publicly and over loudspeakers applauding him and his massive and permitted usury, but that is heresy. Reliance is on God who is the source of all power. It exposed the despicable state of the social utilities in the country, which became even worse after the memorandum, and especially the water services, the most important element of livelihood. It discussed the state of the Army whose small numbers, poor training, and inefficient command were exposed by the Gulf crisis, despite the astronomical and unreasonable figures which had been mentioned and could not remain a secret. On justice and the courts, the memorandum showed that numerous Shari'ah laws had been suspended and replaced with temporal laws. On the state's foreign policy, the memorandum exposed that policy's failures and disregard for Muslim causes and even support and backing for the enemies. The GazaJericho and the case of the communists in southern Yemen are not too distant examples, and there are many others. Upholding temporal laws and supporting heretics against Muslims are prohibited in Islam, as the ulema have ruled. God said ""whoever does not rule by God's law is a heretic,"" and He said: ""But no, by the Lord, they can have no (real) faith until they make thee judge in all disputes between them, and find in their souls no resistance against thy decisions, but accept them with the fullest conviction"". Although the memorandum submitted all that leniently and gently, as a reminder of God and as good advice in a gentle, objective, and sincere way, despite the importance and necessity of advice for rulers in Islam, and despite the number and positions of the signatories of the memorandum and their sympathizers, it was of no avail. Its contents were rejected and its signatories and sympathizers were humiliated, punished, and imprisoned. The preachers' and reformers' eagerness to pursue peaceful reform methods in the interest of the country's unity and to prevent bloodshed was clearly demonstrated. So why should the regime block all means of peaceful reform and drive the people toward armed action? That was the only door left open to the public for ending injustice and upholding right and justice, and in whose interests do Prince Sultan and Prince Nayif plunge the country and the people into an internal war that would destroy everything, enlisting the aid and advice of those who fomented internal sedition in their country and using the people's police force to put down the reform movement there and pit members of the public one against the other—leaving the main enemy in the region, namely the Jewish-American alliance, safe and secure, having found such traitors to implement its policies aimed at exhausting the nation's human and financial resources internally. The person whom Interior Minister Prince Nayif is consulting was not tolerated in his own country because of his extreme dirt and affront to his people. He was dismissed from his post but came to be received by Prince Nayif with open arms, for cooperation on sin and aggression. He filled the prisons with the nation's best sons, bringing tears to the eyes of the mothers whose sons were jailed unfairly. Does the regime want to pit the public, civilians and military, against one another as was the case in some neighboring countries? I have no doubt that that is the policy of the Israeli American enemy alliance, the main beneficiary of all that. But, thank God, the vast majority of the people, civilians and military, are aware of that sinister plan and will not allow themselves to be an instrument for strikes against one another in implementation of the policy of the main enemy, namely the Israeli-American alliance, through the Saudi regime, its agent in the country. That is why everyone agrees that ""a crooked stick cannot have a straight shadow"" and that there must be concentration on hitting the main enemy who has thrust the nation into whirlpools and labyrinths for decades since dividing it into states and statelets. Whenever a reform movement appears in the Islamic states, that Jewish-crusade alliance pushes its agents in the region, the rulers, to exhaust and abort such a reform movement by various suitable means, sometimes aborting it by luring it to armed confrontation, for which it chooses the time and place and through which it would nip it in the bud. Sometimes he would set loose his men in the Interior Ministry, who had graduated from Shari'ah colleges, to confuse and undermine the reform march and to draw the nation and the people away from that march, sometimes luring some righteous men to enter into a war of words with the ulema and the symbols of the reform movement to exhaust everyone's energy and keep the great heresy in control of the nation, misleading it and continuing the peripheral discussions while the worship of God and adherence to his Shari'ah are absent in reality. In these discussions and responses right and wrong get mixed up and often lead to personal enmities, with some people taking sides, thereby further dividing and weakening the nation, so that Islamic action priorities disappear. One should beware of these and similar diabolical tricks by the Interior Ministry. The appropriate behavior in such cases is what has been advised by the ulema, such as what the late Shaykh al-Islam Ibn-Taymiyah said, namely that all Muslims should join hands in warding off the great heresy controlling the Islamic world while sustaining minimum damage to prevent the greater damage which is in the fact the great heresy. When duties are numerous the most important takes priority. It is no secret that warding off that American enemy is the top duty after faith, and nothing should take priority over it, as decreed by the ulema. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn-Taymiyah said: ""Fighting in self-defense is the strongest way of warding off harm to honor and religion, and it is a collective duty. Warding off an enemy who corrupts religion and the world is a top duty after faith. It is unconditional and is done according to means."" If warding off that aggressive enemy becomes impossible without all Muslims of all walks and ranks getting together, then that is their duty and they should in that case overlook some disputed issues. Overlooking such disputes at this stage is less harmful than continuation of the great heresy afflicting the countries of the Muslims. That is why Shaykh al-Islami, explaining that matter, pointed out a main and great principle which should be taken into account, which is that work should concentrate on warding off the greater of the two evils. Referring to the state of the mujahidin and Muslims, he said that if among them there happened to be very sinful soldiers, that would not justify abandoning the jihad against the aggressive enemy. After discussing the case of the Tatars and their change of God's laws, he, may God have mercy on his soul, said that ""agreement on fighting them fully would please God, uphold his word, and establish his religion and obedience to his Prophet. If some among them happen to be sinful and ill intentioned, fighting for leadership or offending others on some matters, and if the religious harm of not fighting them is greater than the harm of fighting them, then the duty is to fight them to ward off the greater harm. That is why one of the principles of the Sunnah and the group is to do conquest using every good as well as sinful person, for God supports this in the interest of the cause of religion because, as the Prophet, may God's prayers and blessings be upon him, said, if conquest can only be achieved with the help of sinful princes or very sinful soldiers, then one of two things must be done: Either abandon the conquest with their cooperation, which means the greater harm of others taking over, or proceed with the conquest along with the sinful princes, and that way the greater harm is avoided and most of the rules of Islam are established, if not all. That would be the duty in that case and in all similar cases. In fact many of the conquests which took place after the orthodox caliphs took place in that way."" What is necessary in such a case is that everyone should do his best to incite and mobilize the nation against the aggressive enemy and the great heresy prevailing in the country and corrupting religion and life. There is no greater duty after faith than warding [daf'] off [that enemy], namely the Israeli-American alliance occupying the land of the two holy mosques and the land of the ascension of the Prophet, may God's prayers and blessings be upon him. The Muslims are reminded that they should avoid infighting between sons of the Muslim nation because that will have dire consequences, the most important being: 1. Exhaustion of human resources ""as most of the casualties and victims would be from the Muslim people."" 2. Exhaustion of financial resources. 3. Destruction of the state's infrastructure. 4. Disintegration of society. 5. Destruction of the oil industries, because the presence of the crusader and American military forces in the Islamic Gulf states, on land, in the air, and at sea, represents the greatest danger and harm and the greatest threat to the largest oil reserves in the world. That presence is a provocation to the people and an affront to their religion, feelings, and dignity, and has driven them toward armed struggle against the occupying invaders. A spread of fighting in these areas would carry the danger of the oil burning which would be detrimental to the economic interests of the Gulf states and the land of the two holy mosques, and in fact to the world economy. Here we pause and urge our brothers the people, the mujahidin, to preserve that wealth and not to involve it in the battle because it is a great Islamic wealth and a great and important economic power for the coming Islamic state, God willing. We also firmly warn the aggressive United States against burning that Islamic wealth at the end of the war for fear of it falling into the hands of its legitimate owners and to harm its economic rivals in Europe and the Far East, especially Japan, which is considered the main consumer of the region's oil. 6.

Terrorist,Animal Liberation Front (ALF),2,0,1,USA,n/a,3,n/a,follower,https://animalliberationpressoffice.org/NAALPO/2021/03/16/the-liberation-of-a-bobcat/,"In July 2013, a bobcat living in a filthy rusted cage was liberated from the clutches of an aspiring fur farmer. The animal was never recaptured_—_a victory in the war against wildlife.

For this and other actions on behalf of fur-bearing animals I would later be arrested by a team of FBI agents and sent to federal prison.

This is what the U.S. Government calls terrorism.

The communique read:

“In the early morning hours of July 27, the Animal Liberation Front visited the
property of Shelli Frazier in the town of Plains, Montana, completely surrounded by the beautiful Lolo National Forest.

Frazier applied in 2006 for a permit to imprison bobcats on her property in a fur farm that she hoped would eventually grow to sixty cats.

Despite already making a living breeding horses, she perhaps felt that this could be a lucrative side business. We arrived at her unpublished address determined to correct her mistake, and watch her investments run free into the wilderness.

Exploration of the site revealed that the force of economics had already precluded any need for the force of boltcutters – strewn about this disgusting and decrepit property were large empty cages, the rusted remains of Shelli Frazier’s dreams.

It was not until we checked every single run in an empty cat hutch tucked at the back of the northern lot that we found the tragic consequences of her business ineptitude. In one of the runs, huddling against the back wall, surrounded by rotting food, mildewed wood, and his own feces, was a lone bobcat.

The sight of a creature so majestic in a state so pathetic cannot be done justice
with words. We have yet been unable to determine why Frazier kept him and him alone, but if it was a sense of sentimentality, it certainly was not evident from his
treatment. Emaciated and filthy, his beauty was evident even through the matted fur and traumatized stare, with his bushy jowls and black ear tufts. To be in such proximity to this creature, staring into his haunting yellow eyes, changed every member of our cell. We could only speculate as to how he had suffered and what he had seen, but we could know with certainty that he deserved a shot at freedom. We opened his cage and left.

Shelli Frazier is not the only cruel human ever to keep such noble cats in tiny cages in Lolo National Forest.

More than two decades ago, Rodney Coronado visited Cole MacPherson’s bobcat prison in the town of Lolo just an hour’s drive south of Plains. MacPherson’s farm was Frazier’s fantasy – a shed of sixty pacing, neurotic, traumatized large cats. Though he was forced to close shop around 2005, the ALF still keeps tabs on MacPherson – today, he continues his dental practice in Missoula. This should be a lesson to Frazier. If you ever again hold wild creatures captive on your land, we will breach it to free them.",481,2.43,1.42,3.24,,,,,,,,,

He lit a cigarette, looked around in the bus: faces, eyes… what do they express? Everything but fear. It is time to leave now.

The early morning of July 21st, in the hotel room 430 was pretty calm. ‘I can’ and ‘I want’ fully charged his will, which had a tough challenge on that day. Every thought born out of faint-heartedness was detected and strangled. The arrows on the clock approached seven, a can of Redbull with a cigarette were finished for breakfast. He did not care anymore about the time on the clock, perhaps this happens with everyone, who dives into the ‘here and now’. The only time he needed, precisely a single moment of it, was the moment of clarity, the point of no return.

The web uploaded his video, where he appears with an AK-47 calling: ‘Happy Anti-System Day! Do not deceive yourself, celebrate the truth’.

He took three grenades from the closet and put them together with the gun in the backpack. A revolver and another training grenade were in the little shoulder bag. The third bag had everything else that could have been needed: from medicines to a mock bomb. The window in the room overlooked the central square – the place, where the action is set to take place, and granite Lesya Ukrainka [Ukrainian Poetess – Akmal] will be forced to witness it. Will she let him in? ‘Yes’, he said out loud.

The evening before he was asking himself questions such as whom and what should he remember in the last, perhaps, hours of his life? Some events, people… Not so many people, but dogs, whom he loved, and with the love of which he saved himself. ‘Do not limp’, he said to himself, and by the effort of will stopped thinking. Sleep had to be the answer to all questions.



The taxi arrived quickly. He did not leave the key from the room at the front desk, to make them think he is going to come back. There were only few people in the bus station; he sat on one of the benches along the platform. There were two conditions when choosing the transport: no children and at least ten passengers inside. He got on a couple of buses, but it was not what he needed. Half an hour later, a blue, transit bus ‘the Etalon’ with more passengers had arrived. He went to look inside and asked what time is the departure. It was perfect timing. With the bags he occupied two seats in back of the bus. ‘The Etalon’ drove off and the countdown now went on for minutes. As soon as the bus left the station, he hanged the automatic gun and the grenades on himself, the revolver was on the side and a bag with the mock bomb on top was put in the passage. The bus stopped and two people got on in medical masks. As soon as the bus moved again, he went to the driver and said: ‘The bus is mined, all stay where you are. Driver, go to the Central Square’ and shot up. All thirteen hostages heard it clearly, but could not yet understand, believe it. He wanted to think it was just a dream. He threw handcuffs to the driver and said: ‘Fasten your left hand to the wheel, turn to the Theater square, come close to the Lesya Ukrainka monument right in front of the police station and turn off the engine’. An old woman in the front seat started to wail and pray fervently, later he will give her a sedative pill. The driver asked to unfasten the handcuffs because his hand was too pressured – he unfasten. The doors were blocked from inside with plastic ties. It’s time to call the police.

‘I am Maxim Plokhoi, I have a bus full of people on the Theatre Square. I have grenades, a machine gun and a bomb with me. Another crowded place in the city is also mined. The video message with my demands is published on my social networks’ accounts. Nobody should be 50 meters around me’.

The demands uploaded to the internet were: the heads of the courts, prisons, police, Ukrainian intelligence service, Parliament and ministries of Defence and Justice, the prime-minister, the oligarchs and the heads of the churches (he named them all) to post a video, where they admit: ‘I am the real terrorist’; the president to post a video ‘all watch the film ‘Earthlings’.

He then told the hostages to call their families to ask them to engage with the media. First police cars stopped 20 meters away from the bus. Several indirect shots through the windows made the police understand the seriousness of what was happening. Later, prior to shooting, he will ask the hostages to cover their ears. A woman asked:

‘Release the child!’.
‘What child?’ – he asked in bewilderment.

She pointed with her gaze at the masked young lad who got on the bus at the bus stop. He was 15. ‘My son is 15 too’, he said and thought: ‘From 14 on, one can be jailed, then it is not a child anymore’.

The negotiator called for the first time. ‘Meet the demands or I will blow it up’, he growled into the phone.

He met the driver’s eyes in the mirror. Every day he is responsible for hundreds of passengers’ lives: they are also his hostages. And when they die because of him, no one dares to declare him a terrorist. He remembered his mother. Seven years have passed. That morning she left on the same ‘Etalon’ and died. What was thinking that voluntary hostage in her last minutes? Perhaps of her son, who had just three months to be released from the prison? He was watching covered bodies in a report from the scene of the accident on the barracks’ TV on that day. The state is the standard of lies and violence, where power is the driver; law-abiding citizens are voluntary hostages and offenders are violent hostages. Sometimes the buses crash into each other with hundreds and millions of victims, but drivers are not terrorists. Why is that so? Where is the justice to be taken? The answer is: to create your own! To create by the maximal action…

Phone calls returned him to reality. Reporters were bombarding him with questions. ‘Come here, look at and listen to’, he told them, realizing that the more cameras are around the less is the chance for the law enforcement to storm the bus. The General got into the role of a negotiator and started stalling. ‘Where is the president? I am waiting for his videomessage’, – that was, what the General heard.

A young woman was holding her stomach.

‘What?’, he asked.
‘I am pregnant, 4th month’.

Visually nothing could be seen. He reassured her as best he could and offered some water and pills. The old woman became quiet: the pills worked. He noticed a shooter hiding 20 meters away. He threw one grenade with the pin half bent towards the shooter through the broken window and told to the General: ‘Send your men to clear it and remove the shooter, I will make sure the grenade explodes in 30 minutes’. The second grenade indeed exploded in half an hour. Hundred meters away from the bus a curious uniformed crowd got out of the police department; – ‘They got too relaxed’, he thought and fired with a short burst up. ‘Don’t shoot, we are doing everything possible! The president was briefed, the minister is here’, chattered the General.

Half of the day had passed; he heard some incomprehensible buzzing over the bus. Through a gap in the open hatch, he saw a drone hovering with a large camera lens. He fired four times from the gun and the revolver, not a single bullet hit. He realized it was a distraction; closed the hatches and looked around. He thought that, if there is an assault, there will be victims that are killed by the Special Forces, but they will say that he killed them. ‘I don’t want blood, I want truth. Do not fear.’ he said to the hostages and shortly added: “It is symbolic that we are right beside the monument to a woman who said ‘One who freed himself, shall be free”.

He chose a perfect place – for many hours the traffic in the centre was paralyzed and hundred meters away stands the cathedral, the theological seminary, where he came 28 years ago in search of the truth. Fifteen out these 28 years he spent in prisons. This cathedral, not the bus, should have been the scene of action, scene of his truth. Because of the lockdown, the cathedral was closed, but he could not wait anymore. He was telling all this to the hostages, they got curious, started asking questions and he was willing to answer them. He wanted them to understand him, to understand what he dared to understand. Last years he was asking himself a question, how to live a day if one knows it is the last one? It was necessary to answer this question, because he realized that the only way to live is to live as if every day is your last day, otherwise it is not worth to live, otherwise it is a lie. Today there was no lie; there was an awful truth. He wanted the hostages to become free of fear, not the fear of him – they did not fear him anymore, – but the fear of being honest.

They run out of water. He called the General and asked to bring some more. The police officer who brought food and water decided to stick his head in the bus to capture more information. A shot over his head brought him to his senses.

The hostages became more talkative and indignant: ‘is it really that hard for the president to record one video clip?’. The General said that the president is in Switzerland and having a reception afterwards, he was clearly stalling: more than 10 hours have passed.

All those serving sentences in camps and prisons of the state did not steal a hundredth part of what any of the oligarchs on his list did; tens of thousands of convicts combined did not kill, maim, or break the fate of as many as did it on ‘legal grounds’ every second of his list. Ministers, priests, politicians, oligarchs, jailers – they have millions of citizens as hostages, and the larger and stronger the state system, the more claims to world domination, – the greater ‘legal terrorist’ the state is. Ten hours have passed and no one of them called and said, ‘release one of the hostages and I will comply to your request’. The embassy of Switzerland received his call: ‘Tell the president that Plokhoi and the hostages are waiting for his videomessage’.

Man is not a king of the nature, he is its terrorist, the murderer of all living; this is what the film ‘Earthlings’ is about. The demand to the president was a priority. The demands to the others – rhetorical, i.e. self-sustained and not requiring a response, a reaction. Why he is doing that? ‘So I need’, his conscience was replying to that; it was conscience, which paralyzed his instinct of self-preservation and made the instinct of justice the main one. He reloaded the revolver, changed the clip of the machine gun. The sun was saying goodbye to the sky over the square. Everyone was breathing the air of uncertainty. He approached the window and was just going to fire a burst in the sky, but a sudden phone call stopped him. The General said that he is going to hand the phone to the president. ‘I will post the videomessage if you release three hostages’. He thought for a second and replied: ‘I am releasing three of them now, you post the message and after half an hour I get out unarmed and release everybody’. One could hear the president joyfully surprised. When the old woman, the adolescent and the pregnant were leaving the bus they heard his ‘I am sorry’; later he will say ‘I am sorry’ again to the rest of them.

Why did he decide to release everyone? He knew they needed more drastic actions, they needed blood; that wasn’t in his script. ‘I made it,’ he said aloud, and put the safety on the gun. ‘It will not take long until each of you will understand that you got more freedom inside you’, he said to the hostages.

It was a long way to this day, and just three steps left; ‘there is no death’, he thought stepping on the tired body of the square.",2117,0.65,0.51,3.13,,,,,,,,,
Terrorist,Animal Liberation Front (ALF),2,0,1,USA,n/a,3,n/a,follower,https://animalliberationpressoffice.org/NAALPO/2021/01/06/pandemic-culture-by-camille-marino/,"For purposes of this essay, I ask that the dozen or so people still concerned about Animal Liberation humor me and assume two facts:

Covid-19 has killed 100s of 1000s of people and; and,
Wearing a mask is an effective method of protecting oneself & others.
I have no doubt that this zoonotic disease is real and has devastated a lot of people. (Although not a single human has been affected anywhere close to the devastation we regularly & carelessly visit upon our nonhuman brethren.) I personally know a few people who’ve been diagnosed and expired shortly thereafter, many more who showed no symptoms or fully recovered. And debating whether those who jumped from a plane without a parachute are included in the fatality stats or whether it’s some asinine new world order conspiracy are distractions. Whether one is right-leaning or left-leaning tends to influence whether they view the current coronavirus as a threat to liberty or a threat to life itself, respectively. Let me clear this up: the only threat is the one we pose to the animal nations. The simple fact is that, no matter where one falls on the political spectrum, they’re likely an integral & active part of our Pandemic Culture.

I challenge anyone to name a recent pandemic that was not zoonotic in nature; that is, that did not directly result from humans destroying wildlife habitats & decimating our natural barriers or by eating animals. Go ahead, I’ll wait… mad cow, ebola, bird flu, swine flu, SARS… nope, I can’t think of any either; but you can get back to me. In fact, you can discount me as a fanatic or extremist, but you may not dismiss the Brookings Institute as easily:

“The devastation wrought by COVID-19 underscores the need for measures to minimize the chances of another zoonotic pandemic. That means radically changing how humans interact with wildlife and natural habitats, preserving terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity, and overhauling food production. Otherwise, another contagion originating from animals could arrive at any time, compounding the disastrous legacy of COVID-19.”

For 43 years, I believed that drinking cow’s milk was natural and healthy & that stuffing bread up a murdered turkey’s anal cavity was a festive way to celebrate family. I wasn’t told that heart disease was a wholly-avoidable leading cause of death. Nor was I aware that high cholesterol, obesity, late-onset diabetes and a host of other standard diseases were caused by eating animals. Like everyone else, I simply learned that big-pharma drugs would alleviate the symptoms. Now we have covid. Same system, different sickness. And while the morning news has catchy little segments like “vaccination nation,” no one is telling us the truth. We are all responsible.

I’m guessing that neither Sean Hannity nor Rachel Maddow got on their respective soap boxes recently to rail against our culture’s complicity in creating zoonotic illnesses. Every single person who continues to eat, wear, or otherwise use animal products is utterly delusional and sickeningly entitled to demand that others wear facial petri dishes to protect them while they actively cultivate yet the next pandemic. Every medium promotes the absurdity that we’re all in this together and most appear to have digested it without question. Sorry to rain on everyone’s animal exploitation parade, but, as long as our culture embraces a wholesale animal holocaust, I’m not in this with anyone but your nonhuman victims… and we all reap what we sew.

So, then, vegans get a free pass, right? Nah, not exactly. Every single vegan who finally crawled out from hiding under the table in 2020 to throw their alleged convictions and the nonhumans under a bus, advocated for animal-torture vaccines, and unabashedly began publicly worshipping the nation’s top vivisector, the degenerate Anthony Fauci, is a special kind of loathsome human-supremacist hypocrite. Maybe they can find one of those equally-useless animal rights philosophers with whom to discuss their new utilitarian bent. In the meantime, I suggest these vegans go find themselves one of those magnanimous vivisectors who are offering all kinds of rewards if they’ll sign up to be human vivisection subjects for their vaccine. Go on, get your dna tweaked. It’ll be fine. And I can hardly think of anyone more deserving.

I thought I’d come to terms with the fact that I live in an insane society a long time ago – we murder the innocent for profit, wear skins torn off their bleeding bodies for style, and eat their remains three times a day while giving thanks to some deity. We sing songs about peace on earth while carving up a pig whose last bloody screams on this earth were ignored. And then when our selfish perversions come back and only begin to give the human race back an infinitesimal iota of the karmic retribution we so justly deserve, we turn our fear and hatred on people who won’t wear on a diaper on their face?! Mutating our RNA and petri dish masks is a solution? That this makes sense to any single individual is incomprehensible. We’ve gone beyond insanity to full-blown social psychosis.

So next time you want to leer at my bare face in a supermarket from behind your mask while you’re grazing in a frozen cemetery or deli case of dismembered animals, I invite you to approach me so we can have a cozy little face-to-face chat.",884,3.11,1.22,2.33,,,,,,,,,

With carefree disregard, we devastate the planet and enslave our nonhuman brethren — the depth and scope of our crimes both unfathomable and incalculable. And every single one of us is stained by the genocide in which we are all complicit. Yes, vegans too. Removing ourselves from the equation of death did nothing to absolve us of our sins; furthermore, we tacitly approve and tolerate a society bathed in blood. I know of no vegan who walks around kicking people in the kneecaps when they graze in the frozen cemeteries at supermarkets. While I’ve done it on occasion, we don’t generally walk around cutting the lines of those who fish — cowards who jam hooks through the faces of unsuspecting animals for fun. We’re still complicit.

Enter SARS-CV-2. The governments of the world are not at all concerned if the masses are thinned, so the hysteria around this virus and the draconian, militaristic social controls being implemented are far more troublesome than the pandemic. I propose everyone resume normal life, go out there and catch our coronavirus, build our immunities or drop dead. Let our infrastructure get overwhelmed, let our artificial and unsustainable social constructs collapse, and, as a close friend observed, maybe revert to an agrarian society. I couldn’t care less where any human falls on this issue, but I challenge anyone to argue that a swift kick in our privilege — a leveling out of the almighty human species — is not a positive development for the animal kingdom we’ve eviscerated.

Every health “crisis” in recent memory has resulted from a contagion jumping species — mad cow, bird flu, swine flu, ebola, sars, covid (or sars2) — purely by virtue of humans believing we’re entitled to to satiate our deviate penchants at their expense. We’ve earned karmic justice, whether or not this one turns out to be anything close. And as far as our nonhuman victims are concerned, Covid is not nearly deadly enough. I don’t expect our arrogance and hubris to recede after this year’s pandemic subsides, so let’s take bets on from where our next gut punch to our human privilege will come. Cow’s milk? Sealife? Unfertilized chicken eggs? I won’t cry when the inevitable next one hits either.

I have, however, been increasingly disturbed by contingents of the vegan community embracing (wittingly or not) vivisectors and their vaccine industry. All hail vivisectors!? We’re now praying to the psychopathic gods of animal torture for our salvation? If we need a vivisector to harm a single animal to save a single one of us, then it’s all over. We as a community that alleges to advocate for animals has truly lost its way.

It’s probably been a long time coming. I’ve pretty much watched in disgust as the business models of welfarism and street theater have replaced activism. We’ve all seen the celebrated groups who see every suffering animal as an opportunity to collect donations. The groups whose marketing acumen has successfully equated staged profit-motivated law skirting with civil disobedience and gained a fawning following in the process. Those who wait for industrial abusers to extract their profits on their victims’ suffering and then swoop in to extract every last penny from their blood — either with self-enriching welfare violation “blockbusters,” donation solicitations for Queenie (a dog tortured to death in a Detroit lab almost a decade ago, her “advocates” protecting her tormentors from alleged radicals because those precise vivisectors are a necessity for them to continue to pad their bottom line), or staged open rescues. If we still need welfare investigations to figure out that animals suffer in labs and other cages, then we’re essentially useless. If we can mobilize hundreds of well-meaning but misguided activists to do photo ops with with a rescued victim but fail to throw our bodies on the machine to shut it down, then Animal Liberation is not the objective. The profit-motivated photo op is. How is this not obvious? What is glaring & painful to me is that we have way too many demagogues, frauds, and self-serving charlatans contaminating activism and leaving the animals on their own.

I opened this essay by discussing our complicity, but I’d never argue that smacking a burger out of someone’s mouth is effective action in the pursuit of our goal. I’d be doing it myself if I thought it would benefit the enslaved animal nations. Our ONLY job when it comes to animals & their abusers is to help the former and make the latter fear for their lives. A wholesale slaughter of vivisectors makes perfect strategic sense. Anyone who torments their restrained victims is nothing more than a coward who has a bright red target on his or her back. Start picking a few off and the rest will run for cover, hiding behind children and old ladies. They’re subhuman scum who’ve relinquished any right to consideration or comfort. So alleged activists waiting for these same cretins to poison and slaughter countless nonhumans in pursuit of a vaccine is something around which I cannot wrap my mind. I remember Walter Bond telling me probably a decade ago that “we can’t rally the troops because we have no troops.” But have we simply dropped all pretenses in the midst of our “crisis” of human privilege and just switched sides? It’s an absolute embarrassing disgrace.

While some are comfortable with the 100-year plan, either to turn the world vegan or form alliances with other militant and radical social justice movements (we may have a few isolated militant or radical actors, but no one is ever going to mistake our “movement” for either), I posit that the animals don’t have the luxury to wait for us to outgrow speciesism and self-interest. Time, like academic musings or theoretical minutia, are functions of our human privilege that are foreign to those in desperate need of relief now. This second. We must grasp that our only job is to stop every single abuser we can and, in the process, save countless more victims than we could ever liberate otherwise.

If we’re too busy to organize focused local efforts designed to undermine exploiters and compromise their infrastructure, then the animals will continue to die. Symbolic actions, candles, and photo ops might be profitable, but they stop no one. Those of us who haven’t been contaminated by mainstream welfarism and social media recipe cliques need to embrace our own radical ideas and trace a new trajectory for those who will follow. Arbitrary acts carried out by sequential individuals can have a significant impact– knock on a vivisector’s door and cough in their face before covid disappears, we haven’t had a good car bombing in a while, send their kids a present in the mail while they’re all being home schooled, they all have neighbors who’d appreciate a nice mass mailing. Or simply do what we know is just — a life for a life. The second one of these miscreants or their spawn comes to harm is the second we become an actual threat. (Edit: May 20 – Since I wrote this almost two months ago, we’ve seen armed militias and right-wing actors showing up at govt buildings in aggressive protests. I’ve wondered when we’ll see Animal Liberation activists follow suit and start showing up at the homes of vivisectors and other deserving abusers with our own weapons. Then I remembered, most of my colleagues are too busy hiding under a table waiting for the gods of vivisection to torture enough animals to death to make their world safe. My disillusion is palpable.)

And since we’ve failed miserably, let’s thank the pandemics for stepping in and maybe doing that of which we appear incapable for now — thinning out the most dangerous & malignant predator species to walk the face of the earth. Unfortunately, initial antibody testing indicates covid’s only got around a .1 to .3% mortality rate, comparable to the seasonal flu. But I have faith in the next pandemic my species continues to court. And I look forward to you all walking around in your designer hazmat suits next time around. I’m sure those selfies will replace the cutsie mask ones eventually.",1369,6.04,1.16,2.77,,,,,,,,,
Terrorist,Animal Liberation Front (ALF),2,0,1,USA,n/a,3,n/a,follower,https://animalliberationpressoffice.org/NAALPO/2020/04/11/on-the-covid-19-virus-and-animal-liberation/,"As of this writing, almost 2 million humans have been infected in the Covid-19 Coronavirus pandemic, and well over 100,000 have died as a result. Even so, although the true numbers are unknown, only a fraction of a percent of all humans have been sickened, and less than 6% of those infected have died. The majority of the 7.7 billion humans wrecking havoc on our planet and torturing and murdering hundreds of billions of non-human animals annually are continuing to go about their evil business as usual. If one believes, as we do, that humans are the real virus infecting planet earth, we can only bemoan the fact that so many humans will likely remain viable throughout the current pandemic.

The source of the current pandemic of Covid-19 is believed to be a “wet market” in Wuhan, China. In a wet market, all kinds of animals, live and dead, are for sale for consumption, many of them still alive in cages, many killed on the spot. The virus is believed to have originated in bats before moving to an intermediary animal widely consumed by humans after sale in these markets.

These markets contain fish packed into shallow tubs that splash water all over the floor. The floors and counter tops of stalls are slick and red with the blood of animals killed, skinned and gutted as customers watch. Live turtles and crustaceans climb over each other in desperate bids to escape filthy plastic boxes. Birds and mammals scream as they are killed; sick and wounded animals crammed into small cages stacked high drip blood, pus, feces, and urine onto other animals in cages below. In the eyes of all of them there is misery and terror. Water, blood, fish scales and animal guts are everywhere. Melting ice adds to the slush on the floor.

For years, scientists have warned that filthy markets crammed full of sick animals are breeding grounds for new, antibiotic-resistant “superbugs.” Some studies claim that by 2050, more people will be dying from these infectious diseases than from cancer. What the world is witnessing in horror in 2020 will someday be common. The United Nations has found that 70% of new human diseases, such as HIV(chimpanzees), Mad Cow Disease, Avian Flu(birds), Ebola(bats) and Swine Flu(pigs) were directly linked to animals used for food.

Amid the Coronavirus pandemic, we continue to be stunned by the lack of serious reporting on the source of the problem. Finally, after weeks of sparse coverage, we are beginning to see the issue come to light through figures that have captured the world’s attention, like Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who stated that “It boggles my mind how when we have so many diseases that emanate out of that unusual human-animal interface [wet markets], that we don’t just shut it down. I don’t know what else has to happen to get us to appreciate that.”

The writing has been on the wall for years. Animal agriculture, in all of its manifestations — from the disembowelment of pigs, slaughter of cows, killing of chickens on assembly lines, to the bloodthirsty “sport” of hunting — is a ticking time bomb. And its not only, or even primarily, infectious agents that are doing the killing. Heart disease and stroke, also the direct result of a flesh-based diet, kill 18 million people worldwide each and every year. We humans have a “vaccine” (a plant-based diet) for this major killer and yet knowingly fail to utilize it.

Unless humans change the way they live with animals, no amount of soap and hand sanitizer, social distancing or ventilators is going to save them as a species. Maybe that’s a good thing.",614,1.58,0.48,1.74,,,,,,,,,
Terrorist,Animal Liberation Front (ALF),2,0,1,USA,n/a,3,n/a,follower,https://animalliberationpressoffice.org/NAALPO/2020/01/08/a-marxist-response-to-the-animal-liberation-and-vegan-movements/,"Greta Thunberg, a young environmental activist, has become a powerful icon in our popular culture. Time magazine named her the 2019 “person of the year.” Many governments and business leaders, including Trump, have lashed out at her activism, and even her personally.

Concern regarding climate change and other environmental issues is clearly growing, particularly in North America. Part of this interest can be reflected in the current movement toward veganism, based on both environmental concerns and an embrace of “animal liberation” in general. Others have adopted an entirely plant-based (vegan) diet for reasons of weight loss and personal health and well-being goals.

How should Marxists respond to the arguments in favor of animal liberation? What position should we take on the growing thought that animals should not be used for agricultural purposes?  Is there a way for us to address this movement in a serious way? A failure to address animal liberation could lead to the perception that Marxists don’t really care about environmental issues, and perhaps to an extent that perception is correct!

It should be noted at the outset that veganism in itself is politically neutral. In their book Vegan Freak: Being Vegan in a Non-Vegan World (2010), Bob and Jenna Torres point out that veganism has representation from every political system of belief on the planet. We can note that Adolf Hitler was a vegan! His veganism was based on a Nazi concept of the purification of the body. We certainly should not dismiss the movement based on his conception of purity! What makes veganism a concept worth exploring is precisely the way that the movement addresses core political issues such as class, exploitation, and alienation.

To begin, we should note that some communists have written off the vegan approach as being liberal or bourgeois in its origins. That is a reasonable response to the narratives currently employed by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). That organization is the most vocal vegan organization in the West. Many may appreciate their videos or online posts about the importance of stopping animal cruelty. Marxists can certainly agree that measures could reasonably be taken to stop needless suffering.

For most of us, however, that’s where the agreement stops. PETA has acted in ways that have, rightly, been condemned as “environmental racism.” Activists such as Pamela Anderson have famously fought against the seal hunt. Attacks on the seal hunt can lead to a racist and imperialist approach which attacks the traditional practices of Indigenous peoples around the world, particularly those based on hunter-gatherer economies. It is very hard to imagine that those living in far-north Arctic regions will be able to find their protein source from plants. Eating seal and caribou are essential to the provision of protein in their diet.

Approaches based on PETA have also focused on personal responsibility and the practice of “ethical consumption.” It has long been held that individual consumers should personally adopt a vegan lifestyle in order to personally stop the exploitation of animals by the agricultural sector. Within a capitalist framework, just how are our personal eating habits going to change capitalist industry?

We also need to explore the fact that when a product has been labelled “vegan” it can literally be sold at triple the price. Most working-class and poor families cannot afford to have their grocery bill tripled. As a result, many workers have ruled out living a vegan lifestyle. To take the argument seriously, however, we need to acknowledge that it doesn’t have to be this way. The vegan diet is typically made of fruits, vegetables, grains and legumes. There is absolutely no reason for such food items to be more expensive than meat, dairy, eggs or honey. Corporations have co-opted veganism by making “vegan” products so expensive. We need to challenge that!

We should also pay attention to the fact that, in India in particular, Hindu nationalism has been used to oppress Muslim people. Many Hindus and Buddhists around the world have embraced vegetarianism, and even veganism. What is concerning is the attack on those minority religious communities which traditionally have included meat consumption in their diet. Many vegans have criticized the practice of halal (or Muslim) meat production in which an animal’s throat is slit, similar to Jewish kosher meat production, calling it cruel. Arguments based on Islamophobic or anti-Semitic claims absolutely need to be rejected by anti-imperialist Marxists around the world.

Vegan Marxism?

Having explored the rejection of a liberal bourgeois argument, is it possible to adopt a vegan Marxist approach? Let’s take a look at a couple of issues which could form the basis for just such a position and practice.

Vegan Marxism needs to take, as its starting point, a solidarity with all workers who are currently employed in the field of animal agriculture. In North America, meat is extremely popular as a source of protein, and as a culinary enjoyment. Many of us retain fond memories of a family day in the summer around a barbecue! At the same time, most of us don’t really want to think about the fact that our meat that we love so much came from a sentient, caring and loving animal. As a result, those workers who are employed in slaughterhouses, meat packing plants, and butchery operations are typically workers at the very bottom of the ladder. In the U.S. in particular, it has been determined that workers in this field are over-represented by undocumented Mexican immigrants.

Several films on the Netflix platform such as Cowspiracy address this phenomenon. Major agricultural firms will employ such workers due to the fact that they can get away with paying these workers poorly. Vegan Marxists must take the material interests of such workers to heart.

Marxists who follow a vegan approach, and ecologists in general, often point out that animal-based agriculture is simply not sustainable. The amount of resources needed to produce a pound of meat, for instance, includes the feeding and grazing of cattle at a level of immense proportions. Animal-based agriculture is currently the largest industrial contributor to environmental destruction.

Take, for example, the deliberate burning of Amazon rainforests in Brazil to make way for cattle ranching. Beef and dairy production requires a massive amount of water and resources such as corn and soybeans, which could be used to feed people directly. Each year, the amount of cattle on the Earth increases far beyond the level that would occur by nature. Cattle used for dairy, for instance, are artificially inseminated so that they will become pregnant and give birth to calves. This is done in order for cattle to be able to lactate, and thereby produce milk. Those vegetarians who consume dairy, eggs, and honey are often quite saddened to learn that the calves produced in this way are typically diverted to veal production. Again, beef and dairy production demands more available land, which, under a capitalist framework, means the destruction of forests (the lungs of the Earth) and the loss of land previously held by Indigenous peoples around the world.

Vegan Marxists also really need to look at the fact that most people living largely on a plant-based diet do so on an involuntary basis. For most citizens of the world, meat is a luxury. For the environmental movement to be successful, all peoples of Earth must not only be considered as equals, but be treated as equals. In North America and Europe, meat and dairy production is heavily subsidized. Those subsidies reflect a decision, made socially, to value such production. It is very difficult to imagine that animal liberation or the ceasing of environmental degradation can be achieved under a capitalist framework. Under socialism, and ultimately, communism, social resources can be harnessed which are based on a more sustainable model of development.

It certainly is possible for Marxists to seriously address the environmental movement. A failure to do so could be dangerous, both for the socialist movement but also for our planet. It is also possible, and arguably necessary, for the environmental movement to seriously embrace an anti-racist, anti-capitalist, and anti-imperialist framework!",1330,2.2,2.2,2.94,,,,,,,,,

Be it the liberation of animals from a p[lace of exploitation to the sabotage of infrastructure or tools used to abuse animals and the earth, Unoffensive receives reports from around the globe to be published anonymously.

With it, there is the question of how to send those reports securely. Whilst in reality, any form of internet communications is never 100% secure, folks can take steps so they are safer online in order to ensure they can keep working without the burden of prosecution by the law. In this post we want to briefly cover the ins and outs of report sending.

Let us start with the most basic of all. You should NOT send reports online over instagram or Facebook private message. It is not private and it is in fact very easy to track down. This might come as a surprise to many, but we have received reports over social media before, and we suspect it to still be a thing in the future. We do not want to know who you are, and if you do not want folks to know who took action, you should not be using insecure platforms. If, on the other hand, you want to publicise an open rescue, that is for you to choose, but we rarely platform that kind of action as it already carries traction in other social media groups.

So how do you actually send a report? We have an exhaustive explanation on our website under the “Contact Us” tab, but we can quickly explain over here. There are two main methods that you can chose from, one being the form within our website and the other one, using a spam email address. Regardless, both of them require a couple of steps before you do any sending.

The first step would be to connect to a VPN. VPN serves as a mask between your computer and the Internet Service Provider. Instead of you asking the questions to the Internet provider, you tell the VPN to ask those questions for you. You NEED to understand that using solely a VPN does not equate to being secure, anonymous or private online. In this case, we only need the VPN to not let your internet service know you are connected to a TOR network (we will explain this shortly!). You can download and use very intuitively RiseUp VPN or ProtonVPN.

Once you are connected to a VPN, you want to open TOR. TOR is like any other internet browser, but it uses multiple jumps (or nodes) to go from the request to the answer. For that reason, it is a lot more difficult to track down your internet activity. It also comes packed with tools that help with privacy and don’t let websites spy on your behaviour. You can download and install TOR (for free!!) in torproject.org

Once you have connected to a VPN and opened TOR, you have two choices. One is to simply fill the form in our contact us and click send. We have it configured so that it is encrypted and only us holding the private key are able to understand the language of the email.

If you do not want to fill up that form, you can instead use a spam email address (never your personal address!) to send a report. You can go to any spam email service like tempr.email, which creates a disposable address without any details where you can compose an email and send it to unoffensiveanimal(at)riseup(dot)net.

If you need to send media (photos or video) you should be aware of metadata. You can read more about it on our website. Once you got rid of metadata, you can simply attach it (whilst still using TOR and a VPN) to any file sharing service (like WeTransfer, also free) and then paste the link to download the files in the same email as the report.

The report should not include any personal details or anything that can give away your identity. We don’t need to know, and we (almost always) simply copy and paste the report without any editing. Be mindful about what you are writing.

It is as simple as that! You can read more about it on our website www.unoffensiveanimal.is/contact-us

Stay Safe.

Not allowed inside, they were asked who they were and what they wanted. One agent said, “hello, we are looking for Gregston Van Pukeston”. The agent Identified himself as an agent with the FBI, ( he flashed a badge that did not resemble typical FBI badge).

He asked the person who opened the door if they were Gregston Van Pukeston; the person replied , “I’m not answering that question”. They agent then said , “that’s fine, the reason for our visit is we wanted to reach out to Gregston because of him being a Press Officer with NAALPO and were told NAALPO is a very reputable news outlet for the animal rights movement. We wanted to ask if Gregston would be willing to work with law enforcement as a laiason to the local animal rights movement with law enforcement.”

The Agent continued “I don’t know much about the animal rights movement and we were hoping Gregston would be willing to (kind) of explain the groups and movement to me. We want to kind of be ( peace keepers) with the movement and keep ” extremists ” from infiltrating the ranks of Animal Rights Groups.”

He asked if Gregston, ” would you be willing to be a laiason and work with law enforcement for these reasons.” Resident responded “Sorry, I don’t answer questions, and I don’t work with law enforcement”

The Agent replied, ” Yeah, we figured that. There is a lot of mistrust and suspicion with law enforcement in the animal rights and activist communities in general. That’s why we are reaching out hoping we could try to bridge that gap”.

Resident Answered “Please do not come back here.” Agent thanked resident for his time and wished him a good day.

During the time of this conversation, 2nd Agent stood on road with arms crossed. Both Agents wore Covid face masks to cover their faces. Both were white males, early 30s,  tall, 5’11 possibly. They refused to give their names or supply a business card, and no vehicle was identified.

[Press Office note: If you are ever confronted by law enforcement at your residence, follow these simple rules:
1. Never allow them into your residence, unless they produce a valid warrant.
2. Never agree to cooperate, and better still, tell them only to go away.
3. If possible, get a photo, name or business card and a photo of their vehicle, in order to alert other activists.
4. You do NOT have to answer any questions they proffer, and indeed, should not do so, no matter how mundane the questions may seem.
5. They are LESS likely to ever bother you again if they know you are completely uncooperative.
6. They cannot hurt you as long as you give them nothing.
7. Agents can and do lie routinely. If their lips are moving, they are likely lying. They do NOT want to be your friend or help you or the animal liberation movement.]",516,3.24,1.15,2.67,,,,,,,,,

EDWARDS: No... it is not. This organization does not go in for violence... in no respect.

WALLACE: You are not involved and never have been nor do you want violence.

EDWARDS: Never will be.

WALLACE: I see... Well... what is your plan then?

EDWARDS: Well this plan is to fight the thing morally.

WALLACE: How do you fight it morally?

EDWARDS: It's a moral condition there -- desegregation is. God Almighty created the races and segregated them...sent them each on their own destiny.

WALLACE: Where do you find that information, sir?

EDWARDS: In Exodus 27 Verse 26...I believe it is.

WALLACE: You don't believe your own papers?

EDWARDS: The news papers?

WALLACE: Yes.

EDWARDS: Christ, no.


EDWARDS: I don't know anything about the last one now, but the first one in Camden, South Carolina, there was not a Klanman involved there.

WALLACE: You know this for a fact?

EDWARDS: I do know that for a fact. Had there been a Klansman involved there, he wouldn't have been a Klanman any longer.


EDWARDS: Let me set him straight there on one thing: This organization here itself -- and I refer to it as a protestant faith organization has been denied freedom of the press. We do not have freedom of the press. We are completely denied freedom of the press...and anything you read in any of the major papers... is mere propaganda... and not the true facts.

WALLACE: You say you don't have freedom of the press, Mr. Edwards and yet these are Southern people, a good many of them, who believe in segregation...believe in it sensibly and whole-heartedly. And their aims then are the same as your aims...why then won't they grant you, who have the same aims as they do, freedom of the press?

EDWARDS: Well...the smaller press does. The smaller papers. The weekly papers and things of that nature.

WALLACE: Well, who controls the dailies and why won't they grant you freedom of the press?

EDWARDS: Well, it is a controlled press...you well understand that.

WALLACE: Controlled by whom?

EDWARDS: Well...we had some presses where they were giving us fair publicity- stop all at once, you go ask them why. They tell you right quick pressure was put on them.

WALLACE: Pressure by whom?

EDWARDS: Well...we won't go into that at this time.

WALLACE: Why not?

EDWARDS: Well...the Anti-Defamation League.

WALLACE: Pressure by the Anti-Defamation League?

EDWARDS: Right.

WALLACE: For what reason? How can they put pressure on...

EDWARDS: Put them out of business.

WALLACE: How can a newspaper down there, like the Atlanta Constitution or the Birmingham paper. How can they put them out of business?

EDWARDS: You must remember that this Atlanta Constitution and the Atlanta Journal there is owned by Cox in Ohio and it's financed and supported by the business of Atlanta. And then it's edited and published by the NAACP.

WALLACE: The NAACP edits and publishes the...

EDWARDS: Well... verbally speaking.

WALLACE: The NAACP edits and publishes the Atlanta Constitution.

EDWARDS: Well, they're more or less behind the editing and publishing of it that's what I mean.

WALLACE: What do you think of the NAACP, sir?

EDWARDS: Well, I don't think much of it.

WALLACE: What's wrong with it?

EDWARDS: Well, I've never found anything good about it.

WALLACE: Well, what...but specifically, what's wrong?

EDWARDS: Well, its... I think, commonly known that it's a foreign inspired organization from start to finish.

WALLACE: Foreign inspired?

EDWARDS: Yes.

WALLACE: Foreign dominated dominated by what foreign country?

EDWARDS: Well...it has a communistic leanings.

WALLACE: The NAACP has communistic leanings.

EDWARDS: That's right.

WALLACE: Foreign inspired and foreign dominated.

EDWARDS: I think that's pretty much established.


EDWARDS: I agree.

WALLACE: Head of the F. B. I.?

EDWARDS: Right.



EDWARDS: I don't have the list at hand...here...I could give you the names and the citations of Communistic activities -- Communist affiliations of the officers...not all the officers but a majority of the officers of the NAACP.

WALLACE: Then J. Edgar Hoover has been taken in. He is a dupe.

EDWARDS: No...J. Edgar Hoover hasn't been taken in... he knows what's going on in this country.

WALLACE: Why in the world would he make a statement like that then, sir?

EDWARDS: Well, maybe he made it, maybe he didn't. I don't know.

WALLACE: He made it, believe me. In one piece of Klan literature that you furnished us it is charged... quote...""One drop of Negro blood in your family destroys your white blood forever"". I take it that you believe that.

EDWARDS: Well, I wouldn't, I wouldn't define it down to one drop... now. But here it stands to reason as common sense, that Mongolization means destruction...it means the destruction of the white race...it means the destruction of the Nigger race.

EDWARDS: I sure will believe in segregation for the simple reason we believe in preserving and protecting God's word. He created the white man. He intended for him to stay white. He created the nigger. He intended for him to stay black. And we believe that Mongolization destroys both races and creates a Mongol which is not a race.

WALLACE: You do believe then, a mixing of the blood of Negro and white, will lead to the downfall of the white race and of the Negro.

EDWARDS: That's right. And eventually the destruction of this country.

WALLACE: Well, I'm sure that a good many Klan members, whether in the Armed Forces during the Korean War or the Second World War, Mr. Edwards, and that some of them were wounded and needed blood transfusions. We were told last Friday by Col. Bryant Fenton, Executive Officer to the Office of the Army Surgeon-General that quote"" Blood segregation is not practiced in the Army Medical Corps.""

WALLACE: In other words, some of your Klansmen probably have Negro blood in their veins, a fair amount of it right now, as a result of transfusions that they received in the Army. By those circumstances, under those conditions, does that mean that they are not white men any longer?

EDWARDS: Well, it could show up in the offspring.

WALLACE: Do you know this to be a medical fact, sir, or is this a mind...

EDWARDS: Well, you have conflicting reports there from the medical side of this thing. Some of them will go along with it. Some of them will not.

WALLACE: What political power, if any, does the Klan wield and where? What important politicians do you influence, or believe in you?

EDWARDS: I'd like to put this over. This is not a political organization.

WALLACE: I know... but there...

EDWARDS: By no means whatsoever.

WALLACE: What political people, for instance in Georgia, are sympathetic to the Klan and its aims? And its methods? The Governor of Georgia?

EDWARDS: Well, we're fortunate to have a government in the state of Georgia, I'll put it that way, we do have a state government in the state of Georgia... some states do not have...

WALLACE: The Governor of Georgia is on your side then?

EDWARDS: Well now... I wouldn't put it that strenuous... The Governor, may I say, is a good Governor.


EDWARDS: Who said that?

WALLACE: A spokesman for Sen. Herman Talmadge.

EDWARDS: I don't think he was a spokesman for Herman Talmadge.

WALLACE: We talked to this man in Sen. Talmadge's office several weeks ago.

EDWARDS: I would like to put it this way that Klan-ish minded people sent Herman Talmadge to the office he holds. Also the Klan-ish minded people sent Marvin Griffin to the office he holds.

WALLACE: Let me ask you this, sir. I have here a statement in the official Communist newspaper in the Soviet Union -- Pravda, September 10, 1956.I wonder if you'd listen to it and then answer me out of your heart how you feel about it?

WALLACE: Quote from Pravda: ""How can one measure the bitter cup of humiliation and suffering from which the Negro people in the United States have been forced to drink at schools, in buses and trains everywhere. There are restrictions on Negroes imposed by the whites alone.

WALLACE: There is the much praised democracy and freedom for you. It is this democracy which Washington, D. C. is trying to export."" Now, sir, what is your reaction when your avowed enemy Communism -- grinds out anti-American propaganda based on the actions of the Ku Klux Klan?

EDWARDS: Well, I don't care to even answer a bunch of skunks of that nature, in the first place. But I would like to just make this one statement that if just such elements of death would leave the Negro alone in this country over here. For eighty-five years we have gotten along with the black race in this country. For eighty-five years we have raised the Negro up from you might say slavery to where he is today. 

EDWARDS: We have educated the Negro. In my home state down there, the nigger faced 3% of the tax. He draws three dollars to every one dollar for the white, right back. That in my home state alone. And then this element of that nature over there... pushing the Negro around... kicking him... using him for a tool... and the nigger himself don't know that.

WALLACE: What do you want to do for the Negro, you of the Klan?

EDWARDS: The same thing that the white people has done for the last eighty-five years: continue to help the nigger, support the nigger, give him his education, pay his schools, pay his teachers...

EDWARDS: Sure.

EDWARDS: Well, the Supreme Court in that decision tore down a pattern, a pattern that had been set for eighty...some seventy-eight years. Three different decisions was handed down and in this decision here the word equal was substitute for the same, well equal and same is two different words.

EDWARDS: I disagree.
EDWARDS: I have been asked a question; was this organization confined to the South. No, it definitely is not and it is operating in Northern states.

EDWARDS: Yes. I'm looking for a Grand Dragon, how about you? You would make a pretty good one.

EDWARDS: It's been a pleasure to be here, Mike.

A lot of people come back to the movement and particularly the auxiliary unitsI didn't want to see a split in Belfast, but it was too late. Some of the staff in Belfast were sympath[etic] to Goldings proposals and so that was too late.Reasons. One was political, and the other was military, they had this...

These were people who tied themselves to their Irish Republican Army. Then I said, ""Now ... it's time to go. Go."" And we did.Born, no, that's Sinn Fein. Three weeks before the IRA.We sent orders to all units in the south. I want 90% of your weapons and money for the units in the north ... and we had no training courses, HQ and everything like that. First, defense for the summer. All weapons and ammunition and equipment for Belfast, Derry and the other places, because the summer is always trouble. So we thought, right and plenty of training, and reorganization, that's it.After internment. Before, anything else was a retaliation, because the British army was bad to the people. So we thought retaliatory action and sabotage. But after internment we went to all offensive, all offensive action.No. It was on retaliation for the bad treatment of British troops in Belfast.The British people say if you stay in Ireland there's a price to pay.More soldiers go back in coffins unless the pressure the government to right thing about Ireland.  Good now. When 1972 good, very good, I think, the best and better IRA for fifty years, more men, ammunition equipment and very, very good morale. And we reorganized everything.Yes.

His wife.They scout out the roads, and escort, right. Yes. Yes. And O'Connell was as well ... we had a driver and two others and another car.Yes. And once I went to Derry, to the funeral, Sean Keenan's son was killed. And they advice was too much activity the British army in their droves, so I said, ""You take me over the fields in Derry."" We did.Well ... one Seamus Toomey. O'Connell, Martin McGuinness, and myself and Adams from the prisoners.Yes. ... And I said and so that's it, .... I want this an IRA ...Well he come to me and said, ""Mr. MacStiofain, how do you do?"" I [thought] this guy has done his homework because he pronounced my name perfect. I said, ""I'm OK, now this is my friend Seamus Toomey, .... O'Connell, Martin McGuinness, Adams, Bell."" So he said, ""Oh, Mr. O'Connell, perhaps you want to sit down to me.""

""It's a fact that one act of parliament can put back the other one."" He said, ""Oh that's a fact of parliamentary life.""

So I said, ""Martin, you have something to say?"" ""Yes, Mr. Whitelaw, I saw your troops, paras, kill people in Derry, they were unarmed civilians."" So I said and others. So no reply from Whitelaw and the staff much muttering, ""No capital alliance.""We want a couple of years, four years ... to withdraw. We want the withdrawal first of January 1975. that was negotiations. Well, political, yes, as well. Yes. Because no, we want all military and political withdrawal. No. But we said, ""Give them a week at the most, but start three days."" No, but you see, if he first said, ""No,"" [we] were [to] give them more time ... another couple of days, then we said, ""One week,"" because I knew that a Cabinet meeting on the Thursday, so I said, ""Whitelaw, OK, that's it, but if there was in the chance to more negotiations right, we can expand that."" But I don't think they were interested.Steele come to me and said, ""Don't tell me you're not starting, your stupid campaign again."" So I said, ""Well, it's up to you people. We never worried about the casualties, we've more casualties in Germany with accidents ... you lost twenty men in two weeks in here, in Ireland."" ""You know what they mean."" And I said, ""Well that's about the troops."" But the British and the UDA broke the bloody truce. No, that is wrong. No ... but I had people I respect there that told you that that's not so. No, that the UDA went into break the truce and the British army in Belfast the British general, brigadier they want to break the truce. No, they, lots of incidents as well in Belfast, Portadown and ... the truce had gone by Sunday night. Well, the leadership first of all units in the north were instructions to get back to operations. And I said the campaign will be stop. Well the leadership had an order to all units in the north, get back into offensive action and we must get intensify the campaign. It was, 22 in Belfast and 14 other parts right, and only two had civilian casualties, and the every bomb had three warnings and the British government and the British army they not give the warnings. No. Nine people were killed then. Two British army, two RUC, one a known RU and a UDA. But there were four innocent people and we regretted all of them. The others were legitimate targets. They were, yes, and we regretted all of them, but the blame was the people who deliberately not given the warnings to the public. No, I don't agree. Oh, well, but if the British government has persistent his policies to the north of Ireland, then you get resistance and I'm sure if the same situation was England, some of your friends would resist it. es. Yes. We have and there was planned an operation to sabotage the factory [that] makes CS gas in 1970, but I then the OC was bad in security and four people were arrested. Right. So then another year an operation was organized for shooting a high ranking officer, who was not, was in the north. But then we had two operations planned for the end of 72, and I was arrested so I don't know what happened, but yes. To make sure that the establishment would see that they must pay dearly for the north of Ireland. And the policies and the prison. I was very, very disappointed, very disappointed. And that was one of the biggest mistakes that Adams made and so yes. The government in Dublin is typical neo-colonial government ... there's no real policy about the north. And saying from the people, whole people here ... went into politics to advance the class interest, his own class.  I was pleased. Four years before I suggested to the IRA leadership that something like that to suspend offensive action and change the tactics. No. No, I do not. Because Major and the unionists have never taken the peace process seriously

Praise be to Allah and Blessing on His messenger, companions and followers

Dear Brothers and Sisters,

I greet you with the Islamic greeting; Peace be upon you and God's mercy and blessings;

It is the will of Allah that I undertake this huge responsibility which Allah has chosen for me and a request from the MB Movement which I respond to with the support of Allah. With the support of my Muslim Brothers I look forward to achieving the great goals, we devoted ourselves to, solely for the sake of Allah.

Dear Brothers and Sisters,

At the outset of my speech I would like to address our teacher, older brother, and distinguished leader Mr. Mohamed Mahdy Akef, the seventh leader of the MB group a strong, dedicated and enthusiastic person who led the group's journey amid storms and surpassed all its obstacles, thus providing this unique and outstanding model to all leaders and senior officials in the government, associations and other parties by fulfilling his promise and handing over the leadership after only one term, words are not enough to express our feelings to this great leader and guide and we can only say ""May Allah reward you all the best"".

We say to our beloved Muslim brothers who are spread around the globe, it is unfortunate for us to have this big event happening while you are not among us for reasons beyond our control, however we feel that your souls are with us sending honest and sincere smiles and vibes.

As for the beloved ones who are behind the bars of tyranny and oppression for no just reason other than reiterating Allah is our God, and for seeking the dignity, pride and development of their country, we sincerely applaud and salute them for their patience, steadfastness and sacrifices which we are sure will not be without gain. We pray that those tyrants and oppressors salvage their conscience and that we see you again in our midst supporting our cause, may Allah bless and protect you all.

Dear Brothers and Sisters,

As you are aware, the main goal of the Muslim Brotherhood Movement (MB) is comprehensive modification, which deals with all kinds of corruption through reform and change. ""I only desire (your) betterment to the best of my power; and my success (in my task) can only come from Allah."" (Hud-88) and through cooperation with all powers of the nation and those with high spirits who are sincere to their religion and nation.

The MB believes that Allah has placed all the foundations necessary for the development and welfare of nations in the great Islam; therefore, Islam is their reference towards reform, which starts from the disciplining and training of the souls of individuals, followed by regulating families and societies by strengthening them, preceded by bringing justice to it and the continuous jihad to liberate the nation from any foreign dominance or intellectual, spiritual, cultural hegemony and economic, political or military colonialism, as well as leading the nation to development, prosperity and assuming its appropriate place in the world.

As a result of this comprehensive understanding of Islam the MB were described as Salafists, Sunni, political organization, sports group, scientific and cultural associations, economic companies and a social idea, as provided in the Quran ""But seek, with the (wealth) which Allah has bestowed on thee, the Home of the Hereafter, nor forget thy portion in this world: but do thou good, as Allah has been good to thee, and seek not (occasions for) mischief in the land: for Allah loves not those who do mischief."" (Al-Qasas, 77)

The Muslim Brothers understand that the Quran and Sunnah include all rules, which may be applied to every aspect of life, and the nation has to choose the best for it. According to these rules, which include many alternatives and jurisdiction, options, may change according to the custom, time and place.

Dear Brothers and Sisters,

Although our ideas, aims and objectives are clear, many people try to define us differently and attribute different goals and objectives to us; therefore, we keep re-introducing ourselves, our principles and our stances to the current affairs.

Initially, I would like to tell those who back the unity of the group that those who sincerely work for their God, religion, and country must be as one unit, despite having different opinions. Those who think that different opinions in the group cause disunity or affect the brotherhood do not fully understand the MB. The MB has all promised Allah to toil for his sake as one unit.

The MB operates according to rules and regulations, which are under continuous review, and development without contradicting the basic principles and the MB with this regard accept the advice and wisdom of all as they follow the aphorism ""God bless those who show me my defects"".

Dear Brothers and Sisters,

I would like to highlight and stress the following points:

We are a group of Muslims and not the Muslim group, since one group cannot monopolize Islam, and praise be to Allah, the MB is extremely popular in all countries of the Arab and Islamic worlds because of its moderate call which stems from the pure Quran and Sunnah.

Our approach and movement are linked and based on each other, the latter is based on the former and our motto is cited in the Quranic verse: ""And those who came after them say: ""Our Lord! Forgive us, and our brethren who came before us into the Faith, and leave not, in our hearts, rancor (or sense of injury) against those who have believed. Our Lord! Thou art indeed Full of Kindness, Most Merciful."" (Al Hashr, 10).

We believe in gradual reform, which can only be achieved through a peaceful, and constitutional struggle based on persuasion and dialogue and definitely not through coercion, hence we reject violence in all its forms by either governments or individuals.

The MB group believes that the ruling system should maintain personal freedoms, consultation (democracy), and to obtain the legitimacy of the authority from the nation, identification of powers and separating between it, is the closest ruling system to Islam and they accept no alternative. From this perspective they participate in political sessions and demand the reformation of the system via the available and peaceful means such as parliamentary and community work which they consider as a duty. They have to fulfill to their understanding of their religion and sincerity to their nations.

With regards to our stance from the Egyptian regime, we emphasize that the MB were never opponents to the regime, even if the regime constantly imposes restrictions on them, confiscates their money and frequently arrest its leaders. However, the MB has never hindered in facing the corrupted policies in all areas and always provides recommendations to get past the continued crisis, which the regime has subjected our country to. They raise the sons and daughters of this nation on virtues, morals and helping others, which all benefits the nation, citizens and the state's institutions.

The MB emphasize that their stances from systems are primarily based on praising the good and opposing the bad, hence they do not oppose anything for the sake of it.

With regards to our Christian brothers in the Arab and Islamic world, our stance is very clear as they are partners and participants in building the civilization of this nation, our colleagues in defending it, partners in its development and dealing and cooperating with them is an Islamic obligation. ""Allah forbids you not, with regard to those who fight you not for (your) Faith nor drive you out of your homes, from dealing kindly and justly with them: for Allah loveth those who are just."" (Al-Momtahena, 8)

The MB believes that citizenship is based on cooperation and full equality in the rights and obligations, except for personal matters, which are according to everyone's faith.

The MB strongly rejects and condemns all kinds of sectarian violence, which is frequent and announces their rejection to all these painful incidents as Christians along with Muslims make one social and cultural community. They also call for frankly discussing the reasons behind this tension and finding solutions to remove all sensitivities to restore the nation as a healthy unit.

With regards to women, the MB has previously illustrated promoting all the rights of women in the economic, social and political field. ""The Believers, men and women, are protectors one of another: they enjoin what is just and forbid what is evil: they observe regular prayers, practice regular charity, and obey Allah and His Messenger"" (Tawbah, 71). We call on all Muslim women to play their role generally and to keep up to date with the current affairs as this benefits our Muslim and Arab nation.

Democracy or (Consulting) is our essential tool, which we strive to adopt and consolidate. All our institutions or associations in the group are based on consulting and democracy beginning from the Boards of People to the office of the Guidance Bureau itself. The MB emphasize that democracy at its core means the non-abolition or cancellation of the other party's opinion and the adopting of the majority's decision.

With regards to Islamic, national powers, political parties, intellectual and cultural elites, the MB believe that everyone should take part in the development and reform and they refuse any exclusion of any individual or association or the marginalizing of any individual's role. They accept the plurality of parties and the freedom for the parties to be established without restrictions as long as it is established within the framework of the Constitution. They believe in the transmission of power between different parties and groups through free and fair elections since the country is for all and its reform is unexceptionally the responsibility of each individual.

The MB prioritizes the Palestinian case and considers it as the most important case for the nation, which measures the standard of loyalty to Islam, and Arabism and they do not spare any efforts to make this cause the first interest of ruling systems and nations until Palestine is free, God willing.

The MB unwaveringly supports the Arab and Islamic nation and supports its fair stances and important issues. They do not hesitate to offer advice to all bodies and Islamic or Arab associations both at the official and public levels and they never stopped sacrificing for the sake of the nation whenever needed.

They transfer the call for unity and cooperation between Arab and Islamic countries to resist the projects of colonialism, western and Zionist hegemony as they call for the unity of the nation and solving the problems within and between Arab and Islamic countries through advocating dialogue and not arms. Here we should remind our brothers in Yemen, Sudan, Somalia, Iraq, Lebanon, Afghanistan and Pakistan that the only way to ensure the safety and security of their people would only come by committing to dialogue and agreeing on the best of these dear nations.

Our stance to the global system led by USA and the west is more than clear. We hold no animosity to the western countries, however we are against this global system, which accepts freedom and democracy for its people and denies our people the same. Its use of its economic power to assert its control over our countries and decisions. The Zionist state seeks the abolition and cancellation of our values, cultures and Islamic identity for its western values, which seeks the destruction of our faith and morals in our countries.

We call on the nation to unite in the face of the Zionist and western project and to overcome above all ideological differences, to end racism and to completely refuse and prohibit any assault on or occupation of an Arab or Islamic country league.

We call on these global systems to be just and fair and to work on bringing peace and cooperation between the peoples of the world and to promote the values of freedom and justice around the globe."" All of you are sons of Adam and Adam was created from dust"" (Albarraz) and the verse of the Quran ""O mankind! We created you from a single (pair) of a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that ye may know each other (not that ye may despise (each other). Verily the most honored of you in the sight of Allah is (he who is) the most righteous of you. And Allah has full knowledge and is well acquainted (with all things). (Al-Hujurat, 13)

The Arab is not better than the foreigner, and the foreigner is not better than the Arab, the black man is not better than the white man and the white man is not better than the black man, except in piety.

Dear Brothers and Sisters,

We look to the future with hope and concern.

Hope is the motto of true believers and it is the reason we keep working with hope. Love and brotherhood is the method in which MB face hardships and; despair is not in the attitude of believers and idleness is not of the mujahid's qualities.

Our concern includes that of all Egyptians, Arabs and Muslims; the whole humanity shares the same concern over the future of the world, which is threatened by conflicts, epidemics, and diseases and scholars pity it because of the global warming, desertification and drought. Concern is also over the unknown future of the globe led by the policies of the superpowers who desired to solely lead the whole humanity for two decades where they thought they could control the other part of the world. However, they were surprised to see rivers of blood and bodies spread in different parts of the Islamic world including Afghanistan, Iraq, Sudan Somalia, Lebanon and Palestine in addition to the economic crises starting one after another with people living in anxiety and concern about their future and the future of their children.

Dear Brothers and Sisters,

Egyptians, Arabs, Muslims and the whole of humanity are expecting and anticipating much from you, and you - God Willing- are capable of taking this responsibility; repeatedly history has recorded your patience, steadfastness, resoluteness and productivity despite the rumours, which are always spread about you.

Offer to the world the real Islam, the Islam of tolerance and moderation, the Islam that respects the pluralism in the world, the Islam of acquaintance and cooperation for the good of the humanity.

Pass through every path and use all means possible to spread the call for Islam between people and strive truly"" Therefore listen not to the Unbelievers, but strive against them with the utmost strenuousness, with the (Qur'an)."" (Al-Furqan, 52).

Persist in your struggle through, statements, writings, speeches, songs, decent films and meaningful dramas. Utilize all means to shed light on facts about Islam ending all trepidation. Promote and adhere to your slogan from the Quranic verse "" Invite (all) to the Way of thy Lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching; and argue with them in ways that are best and most gracious: for thy Lord knoweth best, who have strayed from His Path, and who receive guidance (Al-Nahl, 126)

And dispute ye not with the People of the Book, except with means better (than mere disputation), unless it be with those of them who inflict wrong (and injury): but say, ""We believe in the revelation which has come down to us and in that which came down to you; Our Allah and your Allah is one; and it is to Him we bow (in Islam)."" (Al-Ankabut, 46)

Educate yourselves on the fine virtues and ethics, be models for people, guide them to Allah by being a good example with excellent behaviour, and participate with others in the reform of spirits and morals.

Cooperate with everyone working for the good of Islam and oppose all that is dire, continue in supporting the correct, protecting faith and fighting against infidelity.

Correct yourselves and your houses, seek the virtuous, and work to fix your communities, stand by the oppressed everywhere and restore the rights of people.

Turn to the Holy Quran and the honourable Sunnah of the prophet, the life of the honest prophet and lives of other great people, study it and get the best of it and correct your paths always and always be aware that Allah is watching what you do not what is inside you and await the victory from Allah, which is not difficult. ""With the help of Allah. He helps whom He will, and He is exalted in might, most merciful."" (Ar-Rum, 5)

And say: ""Work (righteousness): Soon will Allah observe your work, and His Messenger, and the Believers: Soon will ye be brought back to the knower of what is hidden and what is open: then will He show you the truth of all that ye did."" (Al-Tawbah, 105)",2768,5.30,2.40,3.88,,,,,,,,,
Non-terrorist,Society of the Muslim Brothers in Egypt,3,1,0,Egypt,2014,2,Tariq Ramadan,Follower,"Follower of Muslim Brothers, grandson of the founder"," I would say we should never ever distinguish or separate, or divorce, politics from ethics. And ethics has to do with religion. The point for me is never to come with religion as a dogmatic understanding, a dogmatic system, and imposing onto politics religion.

This was in fact a concept that came from within the Muslim Brotherhood in the '50s in jail, where a group of people were, was saying, the only true Muslims are us, and Nasser is no longer a Muslim.

The mainstream Muslim Brotherhood movements said no, we are ""Islamiyun"", and we are all Muslims. ""Muslimun"". Meaning that the Islamists have a social project, a political project as different from Muslims who are practicing Muslims and believers. So there is something here which has to do a political vision about the state, but also a vision about the society.

That, that's the very good point. I think that we need a qualification, today, when we speak about Islamist, we don't know what we are talking about because this is what is coming sometimes from the West, and sometimes from secularists in Muslim-majority countries saying you know what at the end they are all the same. They all want what Bin Laden wanted.

That, that's based on nothing but projection and, and nonsense. They have a selective approach towards democracy. If it suits them, that's fine. So the point for me is to put all the Islamists who are saying that they are against democracy, it's completely wrong. In fact, if you look at what is happening in Turkey, 10 years ago, when people were talking about Erdogan, they were saying, he's going to apply Sharia implement Sharia and there will be no democracy. At the end, he's much more democratic and he's much more a democrat than the military, and even some secularist who are ready to use the army against the democratic process.

There are lots of things to do still in Turkey to get a free society, respecting minorities, that's for sure. But if you look at all the other countries, Turkey is much better than many.

I think that from the very beginning I never bought the idea that these were revolutions. if you try to tell me that all what happened on the ground was not known by the West, I don't buy this. This is nonsense. And I said from the very beginning, we are too much focusing on the political equation of what is happening, while the big big question is the economic side of the equation. This has to do with economy and new actors in the region.

What, no. What I'm saying in the book that even Mubarak knew about this mobilisation of cyber-dissidents, and this was known. What I am saying in the book that the only country in which I think it was not expected, paradoxically, was Syria. Because it took eight months, for the US administration to find the people with whom it can work.

Tell me why Google organised the first meeting in Budapest of cyber-dissidents coming from the Middle East two years before...?

I am telling you that this is coming from a support. I don't buy this idea that everything that happened in the Middle East was coming out of nothing. So this is what I'm saying. Now to tell me that I'm patronising the people, no. I think that the people were sincere, and the people were strong. And this is what I still call it, an awakening.

Non-terrorist,Dalit Buddhist Movement,3,1,0,India,1956,1,B.R. Ambedkar,Leader,Leader/founder of the Dalit Buddhist Movement,"“The criticism of some people is hard. In their opinion, I was leading my poor helpless untouchable people astray. They say, ‘today those who are Untouchables will remain Untouchables, and those rights gained for the Untouchables will be destroyed’ and some people among us are bewildered. To the unlearned people among us, they say, ‘Go by the traditional path’ [pagdandi (Hindi), ‘footpath’ suggests that the Mahars should use an inferior path]. On some of the old and young among us, they may be influential. If doubt has been created in the minds of people because of this, it is our duty to remove that doubt; and to turn back that doubt is to strengthen the foundation of our movement.

“Earlier we people had had a movement against eating meat. The touchables thought a bolt of lightning had hit them. They should drink living buffalo’s milk; but, when that buffalo died, we should carry that dead cow on our shoulders. Wasn’t this a strange practice? We tell them, if your old woman died, then why not give her to us? If you ought to give us your dead cow, then you ought to give us your old woman also, shouldn’t you? At that time, some man wrote in Kesari that in certain villages every year fifty cattle die, so that five hundred rupees can be earned from their hide, horns, hooves, meat, bones, and tail. Leaving aside the matter of meat, these people will be deprived of all that profit, so the letter appeared in Kesari. Really speaking, what was the necessity of giving an answer to his propaganda? But our people used to feel that if our lord [Babasaheb] does not give an answer to this thing, then what does the lord do at all?

“Once I went to a meeting at Sangamner. An arrangement for eating in the evening after the meeting had been made. At that time a note was sent me by a Kesari reporter, and he asked me, “Say, you tell your people not to remove dead cattle [from the village]! Look at their poverty. No sari and blouse for their wives, no food for them, no fields for them. When their circumstances are so difficult, why do you say, throw away the 500-rupee profit every year from hide, hoof, and meat? Is this not a loss for your people?

“I said: We will answer you. Shall I answer here on the veranda, or in a meeting? It is good if this critical question comes before people. I asked the gentleman, “Is this all you have to say, or is there more?” The gentleman said, “Whatever I have asked you, answer that much.” I asked that man, “How many children and dependents do you have”? He said, “I have five sons and my brother has five or six children also.” I said, “Then your family is large. You and your relations should certainly remove the dead cattle from the village and get that 500-rupee profit. Besides that, every year I myself will give you 500 rupees on top of that. Whatever will become of my people, whether they will get food and clothing or not, this is my affair and I will look after it. But are you putting aside such a successful thing? Why do you not take it on? If we do the work and get the profit, won’t there be a profit if you do it? Why don’t you remove the dead cattle?

“Yesterday a Brahmin boy came to me and asked, “In Parliament and the Assemblies, your people have been given reserved places. Why are you giving those up?” I said to him, “You become a Mahar and fill that place in Parliament and the Assemblies. If there is a service vacant, then that place fills in no time. How many applications from Brahmins and others come for that place! As places in service are filled in that way, why don’t you Brahmin people, as Mahars, fill those reserved seats?

“If we have suffered a loss, why do you weep? This is my question to them. Truly it means honor is dear to mankind; profit is not dear. A woman of good qualities and good behavior knows that there is profit in prostitution. There is a locality of prostitutes in our Bombay. When those women get up at eight in the morning, they order breakfast from a nearby hotel and say (Dr Ambedkar at this time, giving an imitation in a different voice, said): ‘Suleman, you bring a pound of bread and a plate of minced meat.’ That Suleman brings it. Besides, he brings tea, bread, cake, and other things. But my depressed-class sisters do not even get ordinary chutney-bhakri. However, they live with dignity. They live piously.

Ambedkar,Leader,Leader/founder of the Dalit Buddhist Movement,"I feel, however good a Constitution may be, it is sure to turn out bad because those who are called to work it, happen to be a bad lot. However bad a Constitution may be, it may turn out to be good if those who are called to work it, happen to be a good lot. The working of a Constitution does not depend wholly upon the nature of the Constitution. The Constitution can provide only the organs of State such as the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary. The factors on which the working of those organs of the State depend are the people and the political parties they will set up as their instruments to carry out their wishes and their politics. Who can say how the people of India and their purposes or will they prefer revolutionary methods of achieving them? If they adopt the revolutionary methods, however good the Constitution may be, it requires no prophet to say that it will fail. It is, therefore, futile to pass any judgement upon the Constitution without reference to the part which the people and their parties are likely to play.

… my mind is so full of the future of our country that I feel I ought to take this occasion to give expression to some of my reflections thereon. On 26th January 1950, India will be an independent country (Cheers). What would happen to her independence? Will she maintain her independence or will she lose it again? This is the first thought that comes to my mind. It is not that India was never an independent country. The point is that she once lost the independence she had. Will she lost it a second time? It is this thought which makes me most anxious for the future. What perturbs me greatly is the fact that not only India has once before lost her independence, but she lost it by the infidelity and treachery of some of her own people. In the invasion of Sind by Mahommed-Bin-Kasim, the military commanders of King Dahar accepted bribes from the agents of Mahommed-Bin-Kasim and refused to fight on the side of their King. It was Jaichand who invited Mahommed Gohri to invade India and fight against Prithvi Raj and promised him the help of himself and the Solanki Kings. When Shivaji was fighting for the liberation of Hindus, the other Maratha noblemen and the Rajput Kings were fighting the battle on the side of Moghul Emperors. When the British were trying to destroy the Sikh Rulers, Gulab Singh, their principal commander sat silent and did not help to save the Sikh Kingdom. In 1857, when a large part of India had declared a war of independence against the British, the Sikhs stood and watched the event as silent spectators.

Will history repeat itself? It is this thought which fills me with anxiety. This anxiety is deepened by the realization of the fact that in addition to our old enemies in the form of castes and creeds we are going to have many political parties with diverse and opposing political creeds. Will Indians place the country above their creed or will they place creed above country? I do not know. But this much is certain that if the parties place creed above country, our independence will be put in jeopardy a second time and probably be lost for ever. This eventuality we must all resolutely guard against. We must be determined to defend our independence with the last drop of our blood.(Cheers)

On the 26th of January 1950, India would be a democratic country in the sense that India from that day would have a government of the people, by the people and for the people. The same thought comes to my mind. What would happen to her democratic Constitution? Will she be able to maintain it or will she lose it again. This is the second thought that comes to my mind and makes me as anxious as the first.

It is not that India did not know what is Democracy. There was a time when India was studded with republics, and even where there were monarchies, they were either elected or limited. They were never absolute. It is not that India did not know Parliaments or Parliamentary Procedure. A study of the Buddhist Bhikshu Sanghas discloses that not only there were Parliaments-for the Sanghas were nothing but Parliaments – but the Sanghas knew and observed all the rules of Parliamentary Procedure known to modern times. They had rules regarding seating arrangements, rules regarding Motions, Resolutions, Quorum, Whip, Counting of Votes, Voting by Ballot, Censure Motion, Regularization, Res Judicata, etc. Although these rules of Parliamentary Procedure were applied by the Buddha to the meetings of the Sanghas, he must have borrowed them from the rules of the Political Assemblies functioning in the country in his time.

This democratic system India lost. Will she lose it a second time? I do not know. But it is quite possible in a country like India – where democracy from its long disuse must be regarded as something quite new – there is danger of democracy giving place to dictatorship. It is quite possible for this new born democracy to retain its form but give place to dictatorship in fact. If there is a landslide, the danger of the second possibility becoming actuality is much greater.

If we wish to maintain democracy not merely in form, but also in fact, what must we do? The first thing in my judgement we must do is to hold fast to constitutional methods of achieving our social and economic objectives. It means we must abandon the bloody methods of revolution. It means that we must abandon the method of civil disobedience, non-cooperation and satyagraha. When there was no way left for constitutional methods for achieving economic and social objectives, there was a great deal of justification for unconstitutional methods. But where constitutional methods are open, there can be no justification for these unconstitutional methods. These methods are nothing but the Grammar of Anarchy and the sooner they are abandoned, the better for us.

The second thing we must do is to observe the caution which John Stuart Mill has given to all who are interested in the maintenance of democracy, namely, not “to lay their liberties at the feet of even a great man, or to trust him with power which enable him to subvert their institutions”. There is nothing wrong in being grateful to great men who have rendered life-long services to the country. But there are limits to gratefulness. As has been well said by the Irish Patriot Daniel O’Connel, no man can be grateful at the cost of his honour, no woman can be grateful at the cost of her chastity and no nation can be grateful at the cost of its liberty. This caution is far more necessary in the case of India than in the case of any other country. For in India, Bhakti or what may be called the path of devotion or hero-worship, plays a part in its politics unequalled in magnitude by the part it plays in the politics of any other country in the world. Bhakti in religion may be a road to the salvation of the soul. But in politics, Bhakti or hero-worship is a sure road to degradation and to eventual dictatorship.

The third thing we must do is not to be content with mere political democracy. We must make our political democracy a social democracy as well. Political democracy cannot last unless there lies at the base of it social democracy. What does social democracy mean? It means a way of life which recognizes liberty, equality and fraternity as the principles of life. These principles of liberty, equality and fraternity as the principles of life. These principles of liberty, equality and fraternity are not to be treated as separate items in a trinity. They form a union of trinity in the sense that to divorce one from the other is to defeat the very purpose of democracy. Liberty cannot be divorced from equality, equality cannot be divorced from liberty. Nor can liberty and equality be divorced from fraternity. Without equality, liberty would produce the supremacy of the few over the many. Equality without liberty would kill individual initiative. Without fraternity, liberty would produce the supremacy of the few over the many. Equality without liberty would kill individual initiative. Without fraternity, liberty and equality could not become a natural course of things. It would require a constable to enforce them. We must begin by acknowledging the fact that there is complete absence of two things in Indian Society. One of these is equality. On the social plane, we have in India a society based on the principle of graded inequality which we have a society in which there are some who have immense wealth as against many who live in abject poverty. On the 26th of January 1950, we are going to enter into a life of contradictions. In politics we will have equality and in social and economic life we will have inequality. In politics we will be recognizing the principle of one man one vote and one vote one value. In our social and economic life, we shall, by reason of our social and economic structure, continue to deny the principle of one man one value. How long shall we continue to live this life of contradictions? How long shall we continue to deny equality in our social and economic life? If we continue to deny it for long, we will do so only by putting our political democracy in peril. We must remove this contradiction at the earliest possible moment or else those who suffer from inequality will blow up the structure of political democracy which is Assembly has to laboriously built up.

The second thing we are wanting in is recognition of the principle of fraternity. what does fraternity mean? Fraternity means a sense of common brotherhood of all Indians-of Indians being one people. It is the principle which gives unity and solidarity to social life. It is a difficult thing to achieve. How difficult it is, can be realized from the story related by James Bryce in his volume on American Commonwealth about the United States of America.

The story is- I propose to recount it in the words of Bryce himself- that-

“Some years ago the American Protestant Episcopal Church was occupied at its triennial Convention in revising its liturgy. It was thought desirable to introduce among the short sentence prayers a prayer for the whole people, and an eminent  New England divine proposed the words `O Lord, bless our nation’. Accepted one afternoon, on the spur of the moment, the sentence was brought up next day for reconsideration, when so many objections were raised by the laity to the word nation’ as importing too definite a recognition of national unity, that it was dropped, and instead there were adopted the words `O Lord, bless these United States.”

There was so little solidarity in the U.S.A. at the time when this incident occurred that the people of America did not think that they were a nation. If the people of the United States could not feel that they were a nation, how difficult it is for Indians to think that they are a nation. I remember the days when politically-minded Indians, resented the expression “the people of India”. They preferred the expression “the Indian nation.” I am of opinion that in believing that we are a nation, we are cherishing a great delusion. How can people divided into several thousands of castes be a nation? The sooner we realize that we are not as yet a nation in the social and psychological sense of the world, the better for us. For then only we shall realize the necessity of becoming a nation and seriously think of ways and means of realizing the goal. The realization of this goal is going to be very difficult – far more difficult than it has been in the United States. The United States has no caste problem. In India there are castes. The castes are anti-national. In the first place because they bring about separation in social life. They are anti-national also because they generate jealousy and antipathy between caste and caste. But we must overcome all these difficulties if we wish to become a nation in reality. For fraternity can be a fact only when there is a nation. Without fraternity equality and liberty will be no deeper than coats of paint.

These are my reflections about the tasks that lie ahead of us. They may not be very pleasant to some. But there can be no gainsaying that political power in this country has too long been the monopoly of a few and the many are only beasts of burden, but also beasts of prey. This monopoly has not merely deprived them of their chance of betterment, it has sapped them of what may be called the significance of life. These down-trodden classes are tired of being governed. They are impatient to govern themselves. This urge for self-realization in the down-trodden classes must no be allowed to devolve into a class struggle or class war. It would lead to a division of the House. That would indeed be a day of disaster. For, as has been well said by Abraham Lincoln, a House divided against itself cannot stand very long. Therefore the sooner room is made for the realization of their aspiration, the better for the few, the better for the country, the better for the maintenance for its independence and the better for the continuance of its democratic structure. This can only be done by the establishment of equality and fraternity in all spheres of life. That is why I have laid so much stresses on them.

  I do not wish to weary the House any further. Independence is no doubt a matter of joy. But let us not forget that this independence has thrown on us great responsibilities. By independence, we have lost the excuse of blaming the British for anything going wrong. If hereafter things go wrong, we will have nobody to blame except ourselves. There is great danger of things going wrong. Times are fast changing. People including our own are being moved by new ideologies. They are getting tired of Government by the people. They are prepared to have Governments for the people and are indifferent whether it is Government of the people and by the people. If we wish to preserve the Constitution in which we have sought to enshrine the principle of Government of the people, for the people and by the people, let us resolve not to be tardy in the recognition of the evils that lie across our path and which induce people to prefer Government for the people to Government by the people, nor to be weak in our initiative to remove them. That is the only way to serve the country. I know of no better.

Saturday, March 27, cars, motorcycles, SUVs, trucks, and show cars will begin lining up along Spring Valley Park Road off 29th Street at 2 p.m for the 3rd Kansas City United in Peace Ride and Rally. The rally and entertainment begins at 3 and will continue as riders take off at 3:30 on a route that brings them through the city and back to the park for more entertainment.The free event will continue until 6 p.m. Anyone wanting a more peaceful Kansas City is invited to join the movement and help work toward positive solutions.

“We are working to create a movement of action and hope in the city,” says Bennette Seaman, spokesperson for the Church of Scientology of Kansas City. “Too many people are being killed. In most cases, these senseless deaths begin with a disagreement. As a community, we have to reach out and help others find a better way to resolve their differences. Conflicts should not result in such a tragic end.”

The Kansas City United in Peace Ride and Rally is organized by the Church of Scientology of Kansas City in coordination with United in Peace Foundation, The Way to Happiness Foundation, the KCOGs, PSS, Mo Solar Apps, Mt. Sinai Missionary Baptist Church, Justice & Dignity Center Coalition, One Love, Ground Level Ministries, Happy Foods, Youth Talk Spill the Tea Talk, and local car clubs.


The Peace Ride and Rally unites diverse communities to take action against mounting homicides.
 
The centerpiece of the Peace Ride is The Way to Happiness, the common-sense moral code written by humanitarian L. Ron Hubbard. The booklet promotes positive change and leads the way to a better, more peaceful life.

United in Peace is a multiethnic, multifaith popular movement that unites diverse communities to work together to bring peace to inner cities. Law enforcement and government leaders have recognized and acknowledged a reduction in violence and crime rates in neighborhoods touched by the Peace Rides. In Compton, California, the mayor and city council said, “the presence of the Peace Rides in the City of Compton not only inspired residents to come together in the name of peace, but each ride has also immediately preceded statistical drops in crime.”

The Way to Happiness Foundation is a secular charitable organization, coordinated by the Association for Better Living and Education (ABLE), an organization dedicated to resolving the major societal ills of drugs, crime, illiteracy and immorality. The Church of Scientology and its parishioners proudly sponsor ABLE and its social betterment groups.

For more information on the Peace Rides, watch an episode of Voices for Humanity on the Scientology Network documenting how Minister Tony Muhammad uses these rides to build a peace movement among notorious warring gangs in South Los Angeles.

In times of emergency, the Church of Scientology operates on a maxim coined by Scientology Founder L. Ron Hubbard that “an ounce of prevention is worth a ton of cure.”

The Church compiled the most authoritative and effective guidelines for dealing with such an outbreak and distilled them into a series of illustrated booklets written in simple, direct language anyone can understand. Then Volunteer Ministers across the globe carried out an educational campaign to help their communities understand how to stay well.

In Miami, where the Church routinely works closely with the city’s Latin American consulates to provide humanitarian and social betterment programs to their communities, one of the Volunteer Ministers’ first priorities was to reach out to these officials. They disinfected consulates so it would be safe for them to deliver in-person service to their communities. And they presented them with copies of the “Stay Well” booklets in Spanish so consulate staff could make this information available to anyone contacting them for help. The video shows their The Church of Scientology Miami is open and welcomes the community to visit and learn more about how to keep themselves and their families safe. 

Since 1957, the Church has served a growing congregation. Its new home in North Coconut Grove at 2220 S. Dixie Highway was dedicated in April 2017 by Mr. David Miscavige, ecclesiastical leader of the Scientology religion. 

The Miami Church is featured in an episode of Destination Scientology that broadcasts on DIRECTV 320, can be streamed on Scientology.tv, and is available through satellite television, mobile apps and via the Roku, Amazon Fire and Apple TV platforms.interaction with one of the many consulates they assisted.

“This material is very important,” said Miami’s Honduran Consul describing the booklets. “This is a very articulate effort—an effort which has a lot of commitment. And the information was very systematically put together. In times of crisis, a helping hand is really needed.”

Volunteer Ministers also distributed thousands of copies of Stay Well booklets to essential businesses, gas stations, shops and restaurants. They placed booklets in prominent locations in standees that invited customers to take as many as they liked. ",383,5.12,2.05,3.07,,,,,,,,,

Is there something that can be done to deal with this kind of anxiety and pressure and restore happiness and calm?

Tools for Life Courses, available free of charge on the Scientology website, address these and related issues.

In the mid-1970s, noting a dramatic downturn in social and cultural norms, L. Ron Hubbard had a handbook compiled from his research and writings to help people cope with increased stress and challenges. Tools for Life Courses are based on the 19 chapters of this handbook.

With people searching for solutions to issues worsened by the pandemic, interest in the courses skyrocketed, with an average of 4,000 new courses begun each week. The courses all emphasize application. They contain simple but powerful technology that is easy to learn and use.

One of the courses focuses on raising happy, self-reliant children. Two deal with overcoming anxiety, stress and depression. Yet another takes up helping someone overcome drug and alcohol problems, which increased dramatically over the past year.

The Church of Scientology Volunteer Ministers program is a religious social service created in the mid-1970s by Scientology Founder L. Ron Hubbard.

A Volunteer Minister’s mandate is to be “a person who helps his fellow man on a volunteer basis by restoring purpose, truth and spiritual values to the lives of others.” Their creed: “A Volunteer Minister does not shut his eyes to the pain, evil and injustice of existence. Rather, he is trained to handle these things and help others achieve relief from them and new personal strength as well.”

The Scientology religion was founded by author and philosopher L. Ron Hubbard. The first Church of Scientology was formed in Los Angeles in 1954 and the religion has expanded to more than 11,000 Churches, Missions and affiliated groups, with millions of members in 167 countries.

Their bright yellow Volunteer Ministers vans were joined by the white van of Grantorto, a town near the Church of Scientology Padova, whose mayor decided to take part in their venture after they briefed him on the destruction caused by the earthquake and the hardship it caused the people of the town of Glina.

On return to Padova, Volunteer Minister Ettore Botter, who oversees the humanitarian campaigns of the Church of Scientology of Padova and has participated in each of the Scientologists’ Croatia interventions, organized a webinar called “To Help Croatia and Beyond,” to drum up additional support to help the people of Glina recover from this hardship.

The Church of Scientology Volunteer Ministers program is a religious social service created in the mid-1970s by Scientology Founder L. Ron Hubbard. It constitutes one of the world’s largest independent relief forces.

With the events of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York City, Scientology ecclesiastical leader Mr. David Miscavige called on Scientologists to redouble their efforts to aid their fellow man. He issued a directive entitled “The Wake-Up Call,” which inspired astonishing growth within the Volunteer Minister program.

The following year, Volunteer Ministers of Italy formed Pro.Civi.Co.S, which was entered into the registry of the National Department of Civil Defense.

Pro.Civi.Co.S responded to Italy’s L’Aquila and Amitrice earthquakes, the Haiti earthquake in 2010 and the South Asia tsunami in Indonesia in 2005.

A Volunteer Minister’s mandate is to be “a person who helps his fellow man on a volunteer basis by restoring purpose, truth and spiritual values to the lives of others.” Their creed: “A Volunteer Minister does not shut his eyes to the pain, evil and injustice of existence. Rather, he is trained to handle these things and help others achieve relief from them and new personal strength as well.”

In times of stress, people depend on their churches for guidance and solace, but fear of contagion was keeping people from availing themselves of these services. Orlando Volunteer Ministers took on the sanitization of nearby churches and provided them with copies of educational booklets that make it easy to understand how to keep yourself and your family safe and well.

As the pastor of the Way to Calvary Church of the Nazarene put it in a video on the Scientology website’s interactive timeline, 20/21: A Look Back & A Look Ahead, the Scientologists were on the front lines. “You clean our building so we can be safe,” he said.  He took copies of the booklets so he could share this information with his congregation.

“Not everyone would take time to do what you are doing,” said the pastor of the First Haitian Baptist Church of Central Florida. “This is a great, mighty ministry.”

The pastor of the Apostolic Church of God of Orlando said the booklets were worth a million dollars to him. “The Scientology Ministry is doing this—this benefits everybody,” he said. 

The Church of Scientology hosted the back-to-school drive-thru
The Church of Scientology hosted the back-to-school drive-thru in August to provide Orlando families, out of work because of restrictions, with school supplies and food.
 
With schools about to open last August, Volunteer Ministers partnered with community groups to provide families with food and supplies. The president of the Boricuas de Corazon Foundation described how the Volunteer Ministers began working with her last March and came every single day. “They don’t miss one day,” she says. “They go with us in the warehouse, they do all the sorting, all the packing.” 

One of the projects the Church did with this foundation was a back-to-school drive-thru held at the Church. Families began arriving at 11 in the morning and continued to 5:30 p.m. School supplies, hygiene and sanitation products, and food were placed directly into the trunks of their cars to avoid any violations of social distancing.

“We’re out here making a difference for the people,” said the Sheriff of Osceola County at the drive-thru, “great people who just need that hand up… You guys are tremendous and great in my eyes.”

The Church of Scientology Orlando was dedicated in May 2018 by Mr. David Miscavige, ecclesiastical leader of the Scientology religion.

Scientologists@home is an original series featured on the Scientology Network. Created at the start of the pandemic as a worldwide platform for Scientologists to connect and share how they’re staying safe and making the most of their time at home during the lockdown, Scientologists @home gradually added stories of people getting back to work, and now going back to church. The videos are also available on the Scientology website at Scientology.org/daily-connect.

Since launching on the Scientology Network and the Daily Connect website, the Scientologists@home series has exploded in popularity, with people from over 400 cities and 50 countries around the world, ages 5 to 85, submitting their videos.

The upbeat and optimistic tone to each video is punctuated with Scientologists sharing how they’ve been studying and applying LRH Technology from a number of books and courses, at home or at work, to improve their lives.

The Scientology Network was launched by Mr. David Miscavige, ecclesiastical leader of the Scientology religion, on March 12, 2018. Since launching, it has been viewed in 240 countries and territories in 17 languages. Satisfying the curiosity of people about Scientology, the network takes viewers across six continents, spotlighting the everyday lives of Scientologists, showing the Church as a global organization, and presenting its social betterment programs that have touched the lives of millions worldwide. The network also showcases documentaries by independent filmmakers who represent a cross-section of cultures and faiths, but share a common purpose of uplifting communities.

Non-terrorist,National Rifle Association (NRA),4,0,0,USA,2013,1,Wayne Lapierre,Leader,Vice President of the NRA,"It’s great to be here today, among so many friends, and I appreciate your warm welcome. As you might imagine, I don’t get invited to many parties in this town. That’s okay. I came to Washington when I was about your age, but I didn’t come here to be popular. I came here to stand for what I believe is true.

The political elites may not like it. The liberal media can keep hating on me. But I’m still standing, unapologetic and unflinching in defense of our individual freedom. They can call me crazy and whatever else they want, but NRA’s nearly 5 million members and America’s 100 million gun owners will not back down — not now, not ever.

The Second Amendment is not just words on parchment. It’s not some frivolous suggestion from our Founding Fathers to be interpreted by whim. It lies at the heart of what this country was founded upon. Our Founding Fathers knew that without Second Amendment freedom, all of our freedoms could be in jeopardy.

Our individual liberty is the very essence of America. It is what makes America unique. If you aren’t free to protect yourself — when government puts its thumb on that freedom — then you aren’t free at all.

But they insult, denigrate and call us crazy for holding fast to that belief. In their distorted view of the world, they are smarter than we are. They are special and more worthy than we are. They know better than we do and if we dare disagree, they scorn us, demonize us and try to shut us up. We will not be demonized, we will not be silent.

It’s time for a sane look at the insanity that has consumed all too much of the media and the political class in this town. They wag a condemning finger at the NRA. They call US crazy. But no one — no other organization in the world — has spent more millions, over more decades, to keep Americans safe. Our firearms safety training, law enforcement training, women’s training, hunter education and child accident prevention programs are second to none.

While gun ownership is at an all-time high, we’ve brought accidents with firearms to an all-time low. Every year, we teach millions of lawabiding people how to use, store and defend themselves with firearms.

We’ve been training America’s military and law enforcement officers since NRA’s founding, way back in 1871.

And they call us crazy? They say we’re the problem? In December, I advocated nothing more than surrounding our schoolchildren with the same level of protection as our jewelry stores and sports stadiums — armed protection. The vast majority of Americans agree and favor a trained, armed police or security officer in every school. In a survey of all 50 states, nearly 90 percent of teachers and administrators said an armed officer would make their schools safer.

There isn’t a mom or a dad anywhere who wouldn’t feel better seeing a police car in the parking lot when they drop their kids off at school.

But the powerful elites, who will always have their own security, called our proposal absurd.

You know what’s really absurd? Not protecting our children at school.

Thousands of our schools today remain as vulnerable as ever to the evil intentions of a madman. While Janet Napolitano’s Department of Homeland Security offers this from its website:

“If you are caught out in the open and cannot conceal yourself or take cover, you might consider trying to overpower the shooter with whatever means are available,” a narrator says, while the video shows an office worker pulling a pair of scissors out of a drawer.

Scissors? That’s their answer?

Let’s get this straight. To protect our children at school, we recommend a trained professional with a gun. They recommend scissors. And they say we’re crazy? That’s sheer madness.

Here’s what the political elites offer instead — a placebo called “universal” background checks. Yep, that’s their big idea.

A background check. A check that will always be far from universal, will never make our schools or streets safer, and will only serve as universal registration of lawful gun owners — the real goal they’ve been pushing for decades.

Criminals won’t participate and the records of the mentally ill will never ever be part of the check. With all the HIPAA laws and patient privacy issues, the monsters of Tucson, Aurora, Newtown — those names will never be in the system. And those killers really are crazy!

The very advocates and politicians behind this new universal scheme have fought — behind the scenes, for two decades — to prevent mental health records from being added to the check system. Their check only includes good, law-abiding people like you and me. That’s what they’re after — the names of good, decent people who happen to own a firearm to go into a federal database for universal registration of every lawful gun owner in America.

That’s their answer to criminal violence? Criminalize 100 million law-abiding gun owners in a private transfer? Build a list of good people? As if that would somehow make us safer from violent criminals and homicidal maniacs? That’s their answer? Are they insane?

What’s the point of registering lawful gun owners anyway? So newspapers can print those names and addresses for criminals and gangs to access? So that list can be hacked by foreign entities like the Chinese, who recently hacked Pentagon computers? So that list can be handed over to the Mexican government that, oh by the way, has already requested it.

In the end, there are only two reasons for government to create that federal registry of gun owners — to tax them and to take them.

No gun owner, no rational thinking American, believes that will have any effect on violent criminals and they’re right. It won’t make anyone safer anywhere.

It is troubling and saddening how quickly this debate has deteriorated from what would truly help make people safer to what has proven to be the decades-old agenda of those bent on destroying the Second Amendment. They’ve offered nothing new, nothing helpful in making our schools, our streets, or one child safer.

Senator Dianne Feinstein admitted that she had her gun ban bill ready to go A YEAR AGO, tucked away in a drawer, just waiting for the right opportunity. Really? Waiting for unspeakable tragedy to push her political agenda? And they wonder why most Americans don’t trust Congress.

They are simply not serious about making our kids or our country safer. If they were serious, they’d arrest, prosecute and imprison felons with guns, gangs with guns and drug dealers with guns — as many as they can find. But they don’t do that. They let them go free.

Let’s talk about this thing call sequestration. Now, I run the NRA, not an economic think-tank. But I watch the news and I see that, instead of rational belt-tightening, the first thing the government thinks to do, according to law enforcement officials, is let thousands of criminal illegals out of jail.

Normal people think that’s crazy. It’s as if sanity, itself, has been sequestered in Washington.

We have all these gun laws, with stiff prison time, except the entire criminal justice system says, “We’re not going to do that.”

If federal prosecutors say “just kidding,” normal, law-abiding people say that’s crazy.

And nowhere does that apply more than in Chicago. Federal firearms prosecutions for 2012 dropped by almost 30 percent from their peak in 2004. Federal firearms prosecutions in Chicago dropped 45 percent from 2010 to 2012. President Obama’s hometown ranks dead last in firearms prosecutions — 90th out of 90 federal jurisdictions.

Out of 76,000 prohibited persons flagged by the instant check system, only 13 — 13 — were successfully prosecuted nationwide. Vice President Biden said they don’t have time to prosecute those people.

Excuse me? Don’t have time to prosecute prohibited people trying to illegally get a gun?

The vice president does have time, though, to offer advice to women threatened by an intruder. I’m going to quote him directly.

“Just walk out … walk out and put that double-barrel shotgun and fire two blasts outside the house.”

The vice president of the United States actually told women facing an attack to just empty their shotguns into the air. Honestly, have they lost their minds over at the White House? No doubt violent predators would love to face a woman armed with a shotgun that’s empty.

Well, Mr. Vice President, for four decades you’ve enjoyed the armed protection of Capitol Police and Secret Service officers, all while trying to destroy the Second Amendment rights of the rest of us. When it comes to that right, sir, you keep your advice — we’ll keep our guns.

I see a lot of young women here today. Here’s some more advice from political elites who know what’s best for you:Some members of the Colorado State Legislature think women are too emotional to deal with a violent attack. Senator Jessie Ulibarri said that, instead of using a firearm, you would be better off using “ballpoint pens” to stab an attacker when he stops to reload.

A ballpoint pen?

At the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, officials recommend that women defend themselves against a rapist with quote, “passive resistance.”

Passive resistance? The one thing a violent rapist deserves to face is a good woman with a gun!

They call me crazy, yet the people doing the finger-pointing are saying things that are absolutely bizarre.

I can’t help but think that, as Americans, we all want the same thing. We know our mental health system is in shambles. We all want it fixed.

We want criminals with guns prosecuted and incarcerated. We want the federal gun laws on the books right now enforced against felons with guns, drug dealers with guns, and gangs with guns. If they’d just do that, those violent criminals wouldn’t be on their way to the next crime. They’d be in prison.

We want our children to be safe and protected. That’s why we proposed trained police and security officers in every school.

There’s not a mom or dad in America who wants to leave their children unprotected.

If the Washington elites really wanted the same thing, they would stop demonizing law-abiding gun owners. They would stop trying to convince the American people that all gun owners are potential criminals in waiting. And they would actually implement programs that addressed our problems in a real and meaningful way.

Put police and trained armed security in every school. Enforce the federal gun laws on the books right now. Interdict and incarcerate violent criminals before they get to the next crime scene. Rebuild our broken mental health system. Help the mentally ill by getting them off our streets and into treatment. And for God’s sake,leave the rest of us alone!

The political class and media class just don’t get it. In a lot of ways, they’ve lost track of what this great nation is supposed to be about.

It’s supposed to be about US and people like us, all over this country.

It’s always been about “we the people,” not the political class, all the way back to our founding.

Here’s what I’m talking about.

[Roll Video]


We are the people. This is our country.

This is a fight for our freedom, the freedom that separates us from every other nation on earth. That freedom makes us stronger than other countries. It makes us better than other countries.

That freedom is on the line, now and in 2014 and 2016 and in every election and every political fight in your lifetime. That is what Standing and Fighting and defending freedom is all about.

When I first came to Washington so many years ago, I wanted to make a difference, to stand for something.

This is not an easy place to remain true to your principles. It’s easy to want to be liked and praised here. It’s easy to be swept up in the warped reality that, all too often, is this town.

You are here because you want to make your own difference, take your own stand. Plant your feet firmly in the foundation of freedom, don’t be swayed by the winds of political insanity, and no matter what, let the elitists who scorn you be damned.

Fill your heart with pride. Clear your eyes with conviction. This is your time to Stand and Fight — now and in the next election and the one after that. Now and for the rest of your life. Always stand and always fight for freedom!",2053,3.75,1.76,5.98,,,,,,,,,

Now, I want to answer your question. And, I want to be allowed the opportunity, which is why I am here. To talk and have this discussion with you all and answer these questions. This is why I came down here.

I don't believe that this insane monster should have ever been able to obtain a firearm, ever. I do not think that he should have gotten his hands on any kind of weapon. That's number one.

This individual was nuts and I, nor the millions of people that I represent as a part of this organization, that I'm here speaking for, none of us support people who are crazy, who are a danger to themselves, who are a danger to others, getting their hands on a firearm.

And, we have been, for over 20 years, and I have been screaming about this, which is why I'm here, because I have kids and I'm not just fighting for my kids, I'm fighting for you, I'm fighting for you, I'm fighting for all of you.

Because I don't want anyone to ever be in this position again. I want everyone to think about this for one second, and this goes right into your question. Do you know that it is not federally required for states to actually report people who are prohibited possessors, crazy people, people who are murderers?

No, we've been actually talking about that for a long time. (AUDIENCE JEERS) Let me answer the question. Let me answer the question. You can shout me down when I'm finished, but let me answer Emma's question. It is not federal law for states to report convictions to the NICS system. It's not federally mandated. That's the big question and I wish that this network had also covered this more, as other media networks would have covered it. That's a huge— wait a second, wait a second...

Wait a second! Do you guys want to stop mentally insane individuals from getting firearms. Yes? They have to be in this system. If they are convicted. You can convict them, you can adjudicate the mentally unfit. If a state does not report it to the National Crime Information Center, when you run that form, this individual— this madman passed a background check.

How was he able to pass a background check? He was able to pass a background check because we have a system that's flawed. The Southerland Springs murderer was able to pass a background check because the Air Force did not report that record.

I'm talking for them. These are the 5 million members that I'm here representing. That is what that group's position has been on that. So that answers your question, and they spoke about that before the president made a move and they spoke about that before Attorney General Jeff Sessions made an announcement about that, too. So, that answers your question with that.

Non-terrorist,Revolutionary Association of Women in Afghanistan (RAWA),4,0,0,Afghanistan,1999,1,Unknown,Follower,"RAWA member speech in the converence ""Women in Revolutions"" 11/19/1999","Dear and respected friends,

Allow me to start my speech by greeting you. By this act I commit an offense for which Afghan women under the domination of Islamic fundamentalists imposing Sharia law in Afghanistan are severely punished because they do not have the right to greet or express themselves where male strangers are present. As a symbolic act of defiance I would like to heartily shake hands with each and every one of you because fundamentalist edicts say women should absolutely not do so. To this forum where we talk of women's revolution as one of the most vital task of the moment, I convey to you the greetings and regards of Afghan women who are deprived of their most basic human rights and are unfortunately the most forgotten women in the world.

In various epochs of history, mankind has been witness to revolutions which have changed and shaped world outlook. It is difficult to recall a revolution carried out by men alone. History has on record great and glorious deeds of women who played significant roles.

Let's look at French history. The name of Jean d'Arc as the leader of national resistance against English domination, Marie Paule Parant and Leberte Rose Barreau as key players in the French Revolution stand forth boldly from its pages. Along with men, women and children too laid down their lives on that path. It is not irrelevant that Lenin, the leader of the Russian Revolution, wrote: ""What a formidable nation it would be if the France population were only composed of women!""

During the Industrial Revolution in Europe women had remarkable involvement in organizing rallies and strikes and establishing unions. In Russia, women's struggles were outstanding: from mass strike to establishment of various unions up to keeping the revolutionary spirit alive and vibrant, all were closely associated with the participation of women. Women throughout the ages have participated in armed and unarmed struggles against aggression and tyranny. The memory of heroic women such as Clara Zetkin, Roza Luxemburg, Kolontai and Jamila Bopasha are beacons of inspiration for us.

Like us, the brave women of Iran are also struggling against religious fascism. It would be hard to find any country with so many women prisoners as there are in Iran.

It is difficult for me not to continue to remember and talk about heroic and inspiring women and their achievements and contribution to revolutionary changes in the world, but it would be better for me to draw your attention to the other side of the reality of women's lives and works, namely the inferno of the counter-revolution which engulfs every rebellion and burns women in particular in its flaming hell.

Dear friends,

I come from Afghanistan, from a land under the domination of the most brutal and felonious group of ignorant religious fascists. Our land is in the grip of medieval savages whose ominous acts have no parallel in the modern history of any country in the world. If Algerian religious fanatics cut the throats of their child-victims, Afghan religious fanatics first rape their victims and then loot all they have. I come from a land where the depth of the tragedy of Afghan women is not only that the eyes and ears and mouths and tongues of Afghan women are stitched up under the guise of Islamic hejab (veils) or that they are prevented from going to public bathhouses or going to the dressmaker's, the tragedy lies in the fact that in the vast cemetery named Afghanistan the sick mentality of the ""masters"" of the country is such that neither the rape of nine-year-old girls or of seventy-year-old grandmothers are considered to be too revolting or too shameful. Systematic degrading humiliation and public floggings of women innocent of any crime are everyday events; destitution and starvation continually turn respectable mothers and daughters in to beggars and prostitutes.

Since the domination of Jahadis and Taliban, our country is constantly burning in the grief of thousands killed, cities destroyed, and untold atrocities committed together with looting and the fomenting of racial and ethnic hatreds. In the midst of all this, nearly no voice or hand has reached out to them with a comforting touch.

While the rest of the worlds is set to welcome the twenty-first century, in Afghanistan television, music, film, theater, sport - in the short all manifestations of modern civilized life- are being stamped out by the Taliban. While in other parts of the world women's movements are making significant gains worldwide, our women are deprived of the most elementary human rights. Indeed, they are bought and sold like cattle, humiliated, whipped, beaten, restricted in the their movements, and are considered to have little worth other than satisfying male sexual needs and bearing children. Fascistic restrictions, starvation, scarcity of foodstuffs and basic needs, homelessness, unemployment, war and destruction- all gifts from Taliban and Jihadis- have so darkened the lives of our people and specially women folk that large numbers have turned to beggary, prostitution and suicide. It is a measure of the depth of the tragedy created by the fundamentalists that many desperate mothers and fathers have, out of poverty and necessity, been reduced to selling their children.

It is all the more painful that some ascribe such savagery to the traditions and culture and even the wishes of the Afghan people. Such apologists thus want to hide the real face of Islamic fundamentalists but forget that our traditions and culture have never been so inhuman and anti-women.

Tradition cannot and must not be regarded as something sacred. Many inhuman traditions and customs have been done away with throughout historical development. What goes on in Afghanistan -and termed ""Afghan culture"" by apologists of fundamentalist savagery- are inhuman practices stemming from imposed ignorance. RAWA has never given in to such ""traditions"" and has always struggled to the best of its ability to have them rooted out in the shortest possible time. RAWA strongly believes that selling girls and treating women like livestock and having no respect for their rights as human beings and as women are traditions that need to perish and be done away with for ever. If it is true that our world has become a ""small village"" then should the ""villagers"" allow offensive and inhuman ""traditions"" to defile their ""small village""? Why would the ""villagers"" keep silent and not get actively involved when they see that in a part of the ""village"" a handful of people are committing crimes under the name of religion and traditions? If criminals of war in this or that country are brought to trial why not the Afghan Jihadis and Taliban who have committed and continue to commit the most brutal crimes imaginable?

The only hope that our people look to in this atmosphere of oppressive darkness is the flame of struggle for eliminating fundamentalism and achieving freedom and democracy. Like heroic Afghan women such as Malalai, Nahid and Wajiha who sacrificed their lives for the cause of freedom, the very existence and staunch struggles of RAWA as the only feminist political organization is a witness of the undeniable fact that women in Afghanistan have never bowed down to the inhuman treatment of fundamentalists but have fought back in the most bloody and suffocating conditions for achieving their rights. RAWA is enormously proud of its banner which has been stained red by the blood of its founder, Meena, and which has become an inspiration for all freedom-loving women.

The UN and all countries, organizations and individuals advocating freedom and human rights need to come forward to support in words and deeds the Afghan democratic forces including and especially RAWA as the ONLY feminist organization fighting against the fundamentalists and for democracy and women's rights. Instead of imposing sanctions which will hurt our already devastated people, the US and UN must impose real and severe sanctions against all those countries which arm and fund the Taliban and their rivals.

We are of the opinion that speaking out and struggling for human rights, freedom and democracy is the greatest revolutionary task. Despite being a small organization, RAWA could not have been able to continue its activities if it were not supported by the masses of women. But we feel stronger with the practical support we receive from our revolutionary sisters, and we are strengthened in our resolve to firmly oppose and struggle against all forms and manifestations of religious fundamentalism, be it Islamic, Christian, Jewish or any other religion and irrespective of whether it is in Afghanistan or Iran or Sudan or any other corner of the world.

Dear friends,

As we enter the new millennium, in many countries counter-revolution has taken the form of inhuman religious fanaticism, particularly the Islamic type which is threatening global peace and security and is committing the most savage violations of human rights. Religious fundamentalism, particularly Islamic fundamentalism, is the greatest barrier in the way of women's equal rights movements. We can respond to this terrorism and savagery only by establishing a world wide anti-fundamentalist front, and immensely increasing pressure on those who in any way nourish and arm such elements.

We express our solidarity with all the pro-freedom movements in Iran, Kurdistan, Palestine, Kashmir, Indonesia, East Timor and Latin American and African countries. We wish to cooperate with all pro-democracy organizations but it is a fact that defending and supporting the revolution should not be confined only to speeches in functions and conferences. Practical steps have to be taken in support of revolutionaries of the entire world. We can be faithful to revolutionary aims by not allowing the claws of fundamentalists to tear into the throats of the oppressed masses in various parts of the globe. Revolutionary entities, particularly women's entities, must prove their revolutionary credentials by practical and meaningful cooperation and support to the democratic forces of Afghanistan including RAWA.

Let us hope and work for the emancipation of Afghan women from the clutches of religious fundamentalist fascism. Let us hope and work for a more vociferous voice of protest of the whole pro-democracy community of women and men.

Let the fundamentalist and their foreign masters be terrified by the solidarity of revolutionary women of the world with RAWA.

Thank you.

Non-terrorist,Revolutionary Association of Women in Afghanistan (RAWA),4,0,0,Afghanistan,2009,2,Mariam Rawi,Follower,Member of RAWA's foreign relations committee,"The US invaded Afghanistan to fulfil its geo-political, economic and regional strategic interests and to change Afghanistan into a strong military base in the region. Since Afghanistan is the heart of Asia, it would serve as a strong base for controlling surrounding countries like Pakistan, China, Iran and above all the Central Asian Republics. Additionally, as a superpower, it continues to occupy Afghanistan to combat rising powers like Russia and China, who are becoming greater rivals for the US in the economic, military and political fields.

Many argue today that the 2001 invasion was planned before 9/11, but it gave the war-mongers in the White House and Pentagon a golden opportunity to advance its agenda in the region. In the words of Tony Blair ""to be truthful about it, there was no way we could have got the public consent to have suddenly launched a campaign on Afghanistan but for what happened on September 11...""

Getting hold of the multi-billions drug business was another reason for invading Afghanistan and in the past few years we clearly see that the US and its allies changed Afghanistan into the opium capital of the world. Opium production increased more than 4400%, with 93% of world illegal opium produced in Afghanistan. Narcotics is said to be the third greatest trade commodity in cash terms after oil and weapons. There are large financial institutions behind this business and the control of the routes of narcotics was important for the US government and now they have reached their goal.

Considering Obama's plans for Afghanistan, we can clearly see that there is no difference between Obama and Bush for our country. Both are following a wrong and devastating strategy which has so far pushed Afghanistan and the region towards disaster and deeper conflicts.
Mariam Rawi
Furthermore, Afghanistan holds a rich source of gas, copper, iron and other minerals and precious stones and the big powers are of course interested in looting it the way they are doing in poor African countries. In the past few years there have been exploration efforts of our natural resources. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimates there are about 700 billion cubic meters of gas and 300 million tonnes of oil across several Northern provinces of Afghanistan. Also the world's second-biggest unexploited copper deposit is located in our country with an estimated 11 million tonnes of copper. So besides routing the oil and gas from the Central Asian Republics through Afghanistan, the US is interested in exploiting Afghanistan's resources too.

The ""war on terror"" and ""liberation of Afghan women"" were mere lies to cover the above and many other hidden agendas of the US in Afghanistan. Our peoples' dreams for liberation were shattered in the very first days after the invasion when they witnessed that the war criminals and Northern Alliance murderers and rapists who destroyed Afghanistan, were backed and brought back to power by the US and its allies after the fall of the Taliban regime. When infamous criminals like Burhanuddin Rabbani, Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, Karim Khalili, Mohammad Mohaqiq, Yunus Qanooni, Mullah Rakiti, Atta Muhammad, Rashid Dostum, Ismail Khan, Haji Almas, Hazrat Ali and many more were decorated by the US as champions of freedom and were installed in power, everyone knew that Afghanistan had once again become the centre of a chess game of the US and its allies who made the slogans of ""democracy"" and ""human rights"" into painful jokes for our nation.

Despite many a hue and cry about ""women's rights"" and the ""liberation of Afghan women"", Afghanistan still faces a women's rights catastrophe.

There is no tangible change in the conditions of Afghan women; in certain parts of the country the life is worse than under the Taliban. The rate of kidnappings, rapes, selling of girls, forced marriages, acid attacks, prostitution and self-immolation by young girls and women has reached a record high, even compared to the Taliban regime.

Due to forced marriages and domestic violence, self-immolation by women aged between 18 and 35 is becoming an epidemic in Afghanistan. There have been hundreds of such cases reported mostly in the provinces of Herat, Farah, Ghor and Badghis. Where there is non-existent rule of law and legal support for women, they have no other option but to get rid of their misery by burning themselves.

Due to severe poverty which affects over 80 percent of Afghanistan's population, life for hundreds of thousands of war widows and poor women is disastrous and in many parts of Afghanistan the level of prostitution and begging in the streets has risen to an unprecedented level. There have been many reports of parents being forced to sell their children as they can't feed them. In the western province alone 150 cases of the selling of children, especially girls, were officially reported in 2008 -- the actual numbers are much higher. of Herat

There are many more that are not reflected in the news as the media is strongly stifled under the shadow of guns and threats of the warlords.

In the past few years only some cosmetic changes were made in regard to women's rights. For example, the Women's Ministry and 68 women members of parliament was trumpeted as a big success. Meanwhile the Ministry has done nothing for women and is just a showcase. The majority of women in the parliament are pro-warlord and cannot represent Afghan women as they themselves are part of the problem.

Afghan women have been badly betrayed in the past seven years under the US occupation. Their plight was used to justify the occupation of Afghanistan, but not only were no steps taken to heal their wounds, rather the worst enemies of women's rights were empowered, supported and installed in key posts.

When the entire nation lives under the shadow of warlords, Taliban, drug-lords, occupation forces and a corrupt, puppet and mafia government, how can its women enjoy the most basic rights?

Considering Obama's plans for Afghanistan, we can clearly see that there is no difference between Obama and Bush for our country. Both are following a wrong and devastating strategy which has so far pushed Afghanistan and the region towards disaster and deeper conflicts.

Even if the US deployed hundreds of thousands of troops in Afghanistan, they will not be here to bring ""peace"", ""freedom"" and ""democracy"" for the people of Afghanistan. They will only serve the US's regional interests and help the warlords, drug-lords and other US agents who are in power in our country; but for our suffering and war-stricken people, it will have a ruinous outcome.

Freedom, democracy and justice cannot be enforced at gunpoint by a foreign country; they are the values that can be achieved only by our people and democracy-loving forces through a hard, decisive and long struggle. Those who claim to donate these values to Afghan people through force will only push our country to slavery.

The very first outcome of the ""surge"" for Afghan people will be an increase in the number of civilian casualties which have already sparked protests and opposition from Afghan people. In the past seven years thousands of innocent people have been killed or wounded by the US/NATO bombardments. In the past few weeks under Obama's rule, around 100 Afghan civilians have been killed.

Today many people in Afghanistan ask for the withdrawal of troops and regard them as useless to do any good for Afghanistan. The surge in troops will result in a surge in protests against the US/NATO in Afghanistan and it will also push more people towards the Taliban and other terrorist groups as a reaction to occupation forces and their mistreatment of people.

The troop surge will also give reasons for the insurgency to increase their operations and attacks which in return will intensify the conflict in Afghanistan.

We think the 30,000 extra troops will only serve the US regional strategy in changing Afghanistan into its military base -- it will do nothing to the fight with terrorist groups as they claim. The US and allies are playing a two-faced game in Afghanistan: on the one hand they are increasing troops, and on the other hand, they are supporting the fundamentalist terrorists of the Northern Alliance, and initiating talks with the Taliban and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar to share power with these brutal and criminal forces.

So now it is an open secret that the US is not interested in fighting terrorists. In fact no one can believe that a superpower is really incapable of defeating a small, medieval-minded and ignorant force such as the Taliban. Actually the US government needs an excuse to stay in Afghanistan for longer, so the presence of the Taliban and other terrorist groups give them an excuse for the Tom and Jerry game to continue for years -- the UK have already announced that it will stay in Afghanistan for over three decades.

There are even some suspicions that the foreign troops provide some supplies and arms to the Taliban. Last March the Afghan media and local authorities in Arghandab district of Zabul province reported that NATO helicopters dropped three large containers full of supplies and ammunitions to a Taliban commander. In another move, a Taliban criminal commander named Mullah Abdul Salam, responsible for a massacre in 1998, was appointed as the governor of Musa Qala district in the Helmand province, the world's largest opium poppy growing region.

A few months ago, an infamous terrorist from Gubuddin Hekmatyar's party called Ghairat Baheer was released from the US prison at Bagram airbase. Recently media reports uncovered that he is engaged in secret talks to pave the way for a sharing of power with Hekmatyar who is on the US's terrorist list. According to information revealed to Al Jazeera, Hekmatyar would be offered asylum in Saudi Arabia, after which he would be allowed to return to Afghanistan with immunity from prosecution.

These are just few of the examples that show the US's double standards towards dangerous terrorist bands: whenever the terrorists are ready to work in accordance with its policies, they are regarded as friends of the US, no matter how many crimes and brutalities they have committed and continue to commit against Afghan people.

RAWA strongly believes that the withdrawal of foreign troops should be the first step, because today, with the presence of thousands of foreign troops from many countries in Afghanistan, the majority of our people are suffering from insecurity, killings, kidnapping, unemployment, rape, acid throwing on schoolgirls, hunger, lawlessness, lack of freedom of speech and many more awful disasters. Peace, security, democracy and independence can only be achieved by our own people. It is our responsibility to become united as an alternative against the occupation, to rise up, to resist and to organize our people.

Right now our people are sandwiched between three enemies. From one side we have the Taliban, from the other side are the US air strikes, and from another side are the Northern Alliance warlords in different provinces. With the troop withdrawal our people will at least get rid of one of these enemies.

The justice-loving people of the US and its democratic-minded allies should continue to pressure their government to change its fundamentalists-fostering policy and work for the disarmament of armed groups who are in the pay of the US.

We think the peace-loving people around the world should support democratic-minded individuals and forces of Afghanistan who are being suppressed and weakened by the US and its fundamentalist stooges. Only the emergence of a powerful democratic movement can lead Afghanistan towards independence and democracy.

Afghan people are deeply fed up with their current conditions and are on the verge of rising up against it. We have already seen protests and rising up of people in the face of threats and terror in a number of provinces of Afghanistan. In the future this wave will without a doubt gain momentum. With the emergence of a third front whose slogan is ""Neither Occupation Nor Taliban - Freedom and Democracy,"" Afghans will rise up to get their rights with their own power. This is a long and painful process, but the only option to lead Afghanistan toward peace and prosperity.

Non-terrorist,Revolutionary Association of Women in Afghanistan (RAWA),4,0,0,Afghanistan,2006,1,Unknown,Follower,RAWA member speech in the Conference on South Asian Education Systems,"Dear sisters and friends,

First of all, on behalf of Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan (RAWA), I would like to thank Alliance for Education Development (AFED) and especially Tahira Abdullah, who has always been an activist and freedom-loving woman who expresses her love and solidarity with RAWA. It’s mainly because of her that I have the opportunity to participate in the conference on Girls Education.

RAWA is the oldest political/social organization of Afghan women, struggling for peace, freedom, democracy and women’s rights in fundamentalism-blighted Afghanistan since 1977. Education has been the main focus and priority issue of RAWA, and we strongly believe that only the weapon of education can empower the women of Afghanistan to gain political awareness and participate actively in struggle against fundamentalists. Because of this very fact, despite various problems and obstacles as well as insufficient resources, RAWA has taken the responsibility to administrate hundreds of literacy courses, schools and orphanages in Afghanistan and Pakistan based on its own teaching policy, promoting free-thinking and equality among all people regardless of gender, race or religion.

In countries like Afghanistan, issues such as education can not be understood without taking into account the whole political system. But no doubt, the decades of war from 1979 through the present has badly affected the education sector and deprived a generation of the opportunity to be educated. The puppet regime of Russia destroyed our educational system in the name of democracy and women’s rights, the fundamentalist Jehadis were first who not only called doors of schools “gateways to hell”, but also looted and burned books, schools and universities and kidnapped and rapped hundreds of young school girls and women. The Taliban were the most misogynist and ignorant rulers, officially banning girls from studying at schools, universities and other educational institutions, kept female teachers and doctors from their jobs and converted girls’ schools into religious madrassas.

RAWA member delivering speech in the conference in Lahore
RAWA representative delivering speech on girl’s education
in Afghanistan in the conference in Lahore, Feb.2, 2006.
The millions Afghan refuges in Pakistan and Iran were the most deprived victims of war and fundamentalists rule. In comparison to the 3 million refugees based in Pakistan, only a few thousand had access to education. Until recently there was no common educational policy. Fundamentalist Jehadi groups and NGOs misused funds they received for education of Afghan refugees. For instance, they would receive funds for 50,000 textbooks to be printed while they would only print 5,000 with very bad quality. More importantly, what was the mentality they were trying to build through their so-called education? Many textbooks were not of any use to the students, as books which were supposed to teach chemistry, biology, physics or Persian… were full of Hadis and Quranic verses. The methods and language used in these books showed no understanding of students, their psychology or their well-being. Imagine children in first and second grade who were learned mathematics like this:

5 guns + 5 guns = 10 guns Or, if a Muslim kills 5 infidels out of 10, how many will left alive?

And the shocking and painful fact is that from the very beginning, the US was the biggest supporter of fundamentalists in educational and cultural fields. As an example, Unocal paid $900,000 to the Center for Afghanistan Studies at the University of Omaha, Nebraska to print textbooks promoting a fundamentalist vision. Two years ago, USAID reprinted through the same university, and these textbooks were no different from those earlier written by Jehadi groups. The Washington Post in March 23, 2002 disclosed only parts of the Jihad Schoolbook Scandal.

As an outcome of this critical situation, Afghanistan has one of the world’s worst literacy rates, estimated by UNICEF at between three to four percent for females and 28 percent for males.

Since once again the fundamentalist jehadis of the “Northern Alliance,” which have long been oppressors and violators of women’s rights and education, are back in power with the support of the US and its allies, no radical change has happened in the economic, social, political and educational life of the people, particularly women. In order to deceive the outside world and make happy their masters, the Northern Alliance pays lip service to democracy and women’s education… but their mentality and treatment of women is the same. The biggest threat to Afghan girl’s education is the domination of “Northern Alliance” criminals. That is why in most provinces girls don’t feel secure, are afraid of going outside their homes and rarely have access to educational institutions near their homes.

12 years old Rahima, who was gang-raped in Takhar province on her way to school and girls like Muska who commit suicide to save their honor are clear examples of what life is like for Afghan girls under the Northern Alliance. In short, for the youth, especially school-going girls, life in Afghanistan is characterized by paralyzing physical danger. As a recently released report by Amnesty International explained, violence against females in the country is such that “Daily Afghan women are at risk of abduction and rape by armed individuals. The government is doing little to improve their condition.” Acts of violence against women are rarely investigated or punished.

Since 1987, RAWA has established a number of schools for the refugee children to impart basic knowledge and modern thoughts that the fundamentalists have denied them. Though our schools were closed due to lack of funds in 1996, we are happy to say that with donations received from supporters around the world, RAWA opened around 15 schools in Pakistan. We also have hundreds of literacy course for Afghan girls and women in almost all provinces of Afghanistan and in refugee camps in Pakistan.

During the Taliban period, RAWA, taking a great risk, managed to organize countless home-based classes throughout Afghanistan. Moreover, RAWA’s orphanages offer safety, shelter, food, clothing and a better quality of education in many cities of Afghanistan and Pakistan for hundreds of children.

With further funds, RAWA hopes to establish schools equipped with laboratories, computers, halls, libraries and other modern facilities throughout Afghanistan.

In order to provide all Afghans with good quality education, schools must remain free of cost from primary level up to university. Because of corrupt political and social system, our people are getting poorer and poorer every day. In such circumstances, talking about privatization of education or the establishment of private institutions will, at the end of the day, only fill foreigners’ packets and expand colonial culture. An American university will open in the near future where only warlord’s children can study. Similarly, because both the ministry of foreign affairs and higher education and the embassies are in the hands of the criminal “Northern Alliance”, scholarships never are given to the deserving students.

Afghanistan is still one of the poorest countries in the world. Just as its economic, cultural and social issues cannot be addressed without a radical change in the political system, its education is also a political phenomenon. By political change I mean the overthrow of the criminal warlord “Northern Alliance,” whose power is the root cause of all the miseries and sufferings of our people. Until and unless these criminals are removed from political power, one can’t hope for an essential change in education sector.

Lastly I would like to say that only those governments, organizations and individuals are true friends of Afghan people who not only don’t consider “Northern Alliance” their friends, but also strongly oppose them. We want you not to be deceived by their fashionable and stylish appearances or their speeches in the name of democracy and women’s rights. Just as our people are suffering from the economic terror, political terror and social terror of the “Northern Alliance”, to same extent are worried about education and the dark fate that is waiting for them without it. This is not only RAWA’s message, but it the voice of our people, who want the world to hear them and join hands with them in their struggle against the enemies of democracy, freedom and peace.

On behalf of RAWA, I once again thank you very much for your kind feelings, support and solidarity with the people of Afghanistan and its freedom-loving organizations.",1353,3.11,0.94,6.29,,,,,,,,,

This is a common sense piece of self-defense legislation.”

Senate Bill 24 will strengthen Arkansans' fundamental right to self-defense anywhere they are legally allowed to be.  Law-abiding citizens will no longer be required by law to retreat before using force to defend themselves.  Further, victims of violent crime who respond with defensive force while protecting themselves or their loved ones should not have to face the additional threat of criminal or civil prosecution.

HB 102 strengthens Montana’s self-defense laws by allowing law-abiding Montana gun owners to carry a firearm for self-defense throughout the state without a government-mandated permit. The bill also removes a number of Montana’s “gun-free zones” and ends the unnecessary disarming of Montanans as they go about their day-to-day lives.

Non-terrorist,International Society for Krishna Consciousness,3,1,0,USA,2015,2,Manorama Das,Leader,https://gbc.iskcon.org/an-interview-with-iskcons-youth-minister/,"The idea for the first bus tour came about at a gurukula reunion in Los Angeles in 1993. A group of us said to ourselves, ‘What if we could organize an extended reunion that was kind of like a spiritual camping and road trip combined? We could visit Los Angeles and San Francisco Ratha-yatras on consecutive weekends, and go camping at national parks along the way.’ It sounded like a plan. With the help of a friend who owned an RV and several people bringing their cars, we went on a road trip in 1994 that turned out to be a success beyond what we had hoped for. Then we heard of this devotee who owned a bus in Denver, Kaliya Damana Prabhu, so we called him up and recruited him. In 1995 we embarked on what became the first bus tour, which we called the Youth Harinama Sankirtana Bus Tour. It included Los Angeles and San Francisco Ratha-yatras, the LA gurukula reunion, camping at national parks, hot springs, and a visit to every temple and devotee home up and down California. And, true to our name, lots of harinamas. Things kind of took off from there. I remember, in 2000, joking with our bus driver about taking the tour across North America, following the Ratha-yatra circuit. We thought it was a crazy idea, that it would take way too much driving, way too much time on the road, way too many advance preparations… The dream stuck, and with the support of Madhuha Prabhu and Festival of India, in 2001 we toured the East Cost, in 2002 the West Coast, and from 2003 on, the entire continent. The rest is, as they say, history. It’s magic. I don’t know exactly what happens, but the formula works. Take 50 devotee youth traveling on a bus tour adventure for six weeks across North America. Add lots of harinama sankirtana, Ratha-yatra festivals, and Holy Name kirtans on festival stages… reading from Krishna Book and Srila Prabhupada Lilamrita at night before we go to bed, living on a Krishna diet… I believe Lord Chaitanya works His magic on their hearts and consciousness. The devotees see how these youth are trying to help do their bit to spread Krishna consciousness far and wide, and they give their blessings, and the whole disciplic succession smiles down upon them, and all these blessings have got to amount to something. You can see the bliss in their eyes when they return from the tour, right? (It inspires me to keep on doing this.) I hope that youth come away from the tour with an experience of how fulfilling life can be when we’re serving Krishna together with love, and sharing that experience with others; that they realize Krishna consciousness is about becoming aware of a transcendent Reality that surrounds us and sustains our very being; that Krishna is supremely relevant to our lives, from the life air that we breathe, to the fire of digestion that keeps us hungry for more prasadam, to the Holy Name who manifests on our tongue and fills our hearts with joy. It’s been great to be able to serve on so many tours with my wife, Jaya Sri Radhe, and we’ve grown closer in our relationship through this service. I’ve had many faith-building experiences on the bus tours that convinced me that God exists, that serving His devotees can be blissfully exhausting at times, and that there’s nothing that gives me more satisfaction than to keep on doing this. When I get home, the first thing I do is sleep for a couple of days to recover. But after a week I’m already thinking about the next tour. The biggest challenge is re-integrating into my routine of working a day job to pay the bills, when my mind is already back on the road, planning the next Krishna conscious adventure bus tour. We held an evening festival attended by about 400 townspeople. After a particularly blissful kirtan with our youth, an elderly lady approached us on stage, accompanied by two assistants. She explained that she had been having dreams of a shaven-headed saffron-clad saintly personality with a golden complexion. She said that during our kirtan she again had a vision of Him, glowing effulgently, like molten gold, dancing in the kirtan. She wondered what the meaning of this was and if we could explain. We brought a copy of the Chaitanya Charitamrita from the bus, and began to show her paintings of Lord Chaitanya. The old lady broke out in tears and exclaimed that this was Him! This was the person she had seen dancing during the kirtan, and the person who had appeared to her in dreams since she was a little girl. She looked at the paintings as if in deep meditation for a while, then thanked us profusely, and gave us some good-luck crystals that she seemed to manifest from her hands, out of thin air. It was truly bizarre. She must have been a yogini of sorts. One of the persons who accompanied her explained that she was a clairvoyant. Moments later she disappeared in the crowds and we have never seen her since. We put the magic crystals she gave us on the bus tour altar as an offering to Sri Sri Gaura Nitai.",887,5.82,1.68,1.12,,,,,,,,,

tried everything to bring Him back to health , we ' re just not pure
e nough . And so we don 't think He 's going to appear for the Rathay atra unless Your Divine Grace personal ly comes. Only by your
pure devot ion to Lord Jagannatha can the Lord become cured from
this transcendental illness. So when Prabhupada was in Europe
he got this letter and he canceled his tour. And he f lew in for
the Rathayatra . Now I ' m not sure if this ... I know this s tory took
p lace , but whether it was ' 7 1 or '73 , I ' m not sure which Rathayatra
it was . But anyway , Prabhupada was coming , it was 1971 . So K arandhar and I had gone up to the festival to organi ze it . And then
Prabhupada arrived the evening before the Rathayatra and the senior
devo tees went to the airport to p ick him up and it was tumultuous,
one of the greatest airport arrival s. I did not go myself because
I was in the k itchen cooking. But I had been to ld the de scription
of the devotees throwi ng yogurt , falling all over each other , throwi ng f lowers , j umpin over seats , innocent passengers being pushed
aside . And it was j ust one of those tumultuous , wild airport greeti ngs; conchshells b lowing , the whole thing . So we didn 't see Prabhup ada that evening because he went to his quarters. And the next
morning , I don't k now if Prabhupada gave the morning class but I
had been dropped off at the field with a small crew of me n at around 
Srila Ramesvara , Tape I ( SR I)
dd--2
5 or 6 a . m. so I didn 't s ee Prabhupada that morning either . So I
hadn 't seen Prabhupada yet . And one by one all the members o f .
my
crew were deserting and they were racing down the whole , whatever
the name of that road is, in Golden Gate Park to get to the starti ng point of the parade to be there with Prabhupada . So by around
9 or 10 in the morning I was left all alone at the park and I was
organizing with the karmi s , the people in the park , setting up the
festival , setting up the prasadam booth and so on . And we were
working straight through the parade and then f inal ly the parade
came , the carts came , and there was this beautiful trans cendental
procession of devotees comig from the Subhadra chariot . The whole
park was full , completely full. There must have been between 10
and 20,000 people there in this meadow . And it was completely packed .
And right through the middle of the crowd a procession was weaving
its way like a beauti ful snake , j ust weaving its waj through the
procession. And Vi snuj ana Maharaja was there l eading the kirtan .
And right in the middle of the procession was Prabhupada . And
although this was the first time I ' d ever seen him , and although he
was not as tall as the devotees around him , he stood out so distinctly,
it was his effulgence and the transcendental atmosphere around him .
It was very distinct . And everyone could understand that the spiritual master , a great spiritual personality had arrived . So this
beauti ful proces sion wove its way all the way to the stage and then
there was an introductory kirtan on the stage . And I was still
working in the prasadam booth . I j ust looked up to see the procession and to see Prabhupada, and then I went right back to work .
And then fi nally after the introductory kirtan Prabhupada began to
speak . And j ust before he began to speak he asked to see the prasadam 
SR I

that was being distributed. So that year the budget for prasadam
was very low . And no one had made any preparations for Prabhupada
to take prasadam at the festival. So the devotees from the stage
ran up to me because I was the only devotee in the food booth .
Everyone else was at the stage with Prabhupada . And they said ,
"" Prabhupada wants to s ample the prasadam . Make up a plate . 11 so I
made up a plate . It was a paper plate and a plastic spoon and a
plastic cup. The plastic cup had some lemonade in it and the plate
consisted of grapes and some bread , sweet bread , and a sweet . And I
think that 's al l there was . There were four preparations . There
was bread , grapes , a sweet and the lemonade . There might have been
one other preparation like .•• no , there wasn 't a popper , j ust the
bread ••• Maybe there was a mashed potato or a Gauranga potato ,
but I even doubt that . It was such a terrible feast . So I was so
disturbed to make up this plate for Prabhupada, I knew it would
be ·very di spleasing . So anyway we made up the plate for Prabhupada,
the plate was carried to him by some servant , and then gradual ly •••
I was sti ll busily working to get everything set up for serving out
the prasadam when the word came back that Prab.hupada wouldn 't • • •
he ·took one ·look at it and he wouldn 't even touch it , he wouldn 't
even taste ·any of it . He was very angry and he gave very strong
i nstructions that never again during a Rathayatra festival should
there be such skimpy prasadam. It should be so opulent with subjis
and potatoes· and all kinds of things . He was very disturbed . And
at one ·point Prabhupada wanted to dri nk some water and we didn't
have ·any water in the f ield . And we were running around . Final ly
in another park we found a hose , in another meadow , and we fi lled
one of these plastic dixie cups with the hose water and we brought 
SR I
dd--4
it to Prabhupada; So this wasn 't very together and Prabhupada was
very disturbed . So finally in the middle of his lecture the GBC
came to the food booth to i nspect it because he had been chastised .
And when he saw me there all alone he realized that I had not been
relieved yet and I hadn 't s een Prabhupada . So he rel ieved me and
I went to the stage, I worked my way. through the thick crowd and
I got right up to the front of the stage . And there 's a beauti ful
picture of Prabhupada at thi s Rathayatra festival . It was printed
on the back cover of the o ld Reservo ir of Pleasure that we used to
distribute . And Prabhupada 's face was so beautiful , so golden ,
g lowing. He h ad a red vyasas ana . And when I saw Prabhupada , I just
froze and all my feel ing of devotion was becoming mani fest . And at
o ne point Prabhupada looked at me, he saw me looking at him very
intently with whatever little devoton I had . And when Prabhupada
looked down on me he didn 't smile, he j ust looked at me in a way
that I could understand that he was seeing that I was very devoted .
And then he went on ••• he continued speaking and I j ust burst into
tears . And that was my first actual gl impse of Sri la Prabhupada .
Then the next time I saw Prabhupada was in 1972 . At this time our
book distribution had j ust begun . The beginnings of book distribution was almost , you could say an accidental discovery . For some
time we al l knew that Prabhupada 's main work was to translate hi s
books and to have them distributed . And the conception in the
Society was that the magazines, Back to Godhead , could be di stributed
on the street sankirtana party, the Harinama party , but that books
could only be sold through book stores or to libraries or to col leges .
So the only book di stribution that was going on in those early days ,
' 6 9, ' 6 8, ' 7 0, was that type of sankirtana where one person was 
SR I
dd--5
designated in the temple to make appointments and vis it l ibrarians
and book stores . No one ever thought that you could take a book
out on the street the way-you take the Back to Godhead out . So this
was going on for a couple of years . Actually it was my service in
the first year and a half that I was in the temples , to organize
this type of book distribution . So in 197 1, a devotee in San
Francisco named Premarnava dasa and another devotee named Buddhimanta
dasa , they had the idea that they could go with the hardbound de luxe
Krsna Book volume s that had j ust been printed and di stribute them
in front of a grocery store . And the way they got this idea was
very interes ting . One day they were coming home from some Harinama
party and they had a few hardbound Krsna Books in the vehicle and
they stopped at a gas station . And when it came time to pay for
the gas , one of them j ust had the idea to bring out the Krsna Book
and show it to the person . And as they began preaching and they
saw that the gas station attendant was very interested in the book ,
they suggested that i nstead of paying him for the gas he take the
book . And he agreed ! So that was astonishing . And from that incident they got the idea to try taking the Krsna Books to the grocery
store or the supermarket which was across the street from the San
Francisco temple . Now this isn 't the first time Krsna Books were
di stributed . The first time Krsna Books were distributed was the
day they a rrived , which was I think the 19 70 Rathayatra . And all
the advance copies during that festival were sold , including Prabhupada ' s personal copies. But since that time nobody had done anything
with Krsna Books other than the s tores and the libraries .",1785,1.41,0.84,1.91,,,,,,,,,

Non-terrorist,Camp for Climate Action,4,0,0,USA,2012,2,n/a,leader,https://libcom.org/library/interview-catherine-climate-camp,"The Camp for Climate Action spearheads a radical movement against the “causes of climate change”. What are those causes?

I’m no expert but the key cause of climate change is the release of carbon out of the earth back up into the atmosphere as CO2. All the carbon from the trees and plants that have been slowly getting squashed to make coal, oil and gas over millions of years is now being released very quickly into the atmosphere. This quick release started at the Industrial Revolution and has been speeding up ever since. So the main cause is the burning of these fossil fuels for transport (e.g. cars and planes), making electricity (e.g. coal and gas fired power stations) and the manufacture of just about everything we use in the modern world (e.g. fertiliser for food from oil, electricity for factories and homes). There is also methane, emitted by the huge amount of cows we now have on earth, landfill (where household waste is buried underground) and other places such as the permafrost, which is now starting to melt and release huge amounts of methane.

You can therefore say that behind this, a key cause is modern life – capitalism and consumerism which focus only on profit. Also the individualistic nature of these, where other people and our impacts on them (whether in producing trainers or losing agricultural land through climate change) are ignored. This is completely unsustainable in every sense of the word – we depend on the earth for our survival (air, water, food) so destroying it is not an option if we are to survive. But the way we live, or at least those of us that do the mass consuming and live in capitalist systems, is doing just that.

The Camps were no spontaneous gatherings but were meticulously organised. How many people were involved with the planning process?

I’d say around 150. Some of these were working on camp stuff for an hour a week or less, others were doing it more like a part time job for several months. Some worked on the camp over 8 months, others did their bit nearer the start or end of the process. At each monthly weekend-long gathering (where key decisions were made) there were 50-80 people. Some people came to every gathering, some to most and some just to one. So there was a core of the same people (maybe 30) every time but also the group was different every time.

Working groups also met at these gatherings. These were smaller groups with a specific focus e.g. Networking (website, media and publicising the camp) and Site Practicalities (infrastructure and transport). They had autonomy to work on their particular areas but any big decisions, which affected the whole process or camp, were taken to the full gathering and decided by everyone. There were also smaller working groups (e.g. entertainments, kids) who mainly met at other times or worked together through phone calls and e-mail. All members of working groups did lots of work outside of gatherings and many met between as well as at them.

In gatherings and working group meetings consensus decision-making was used – allowing all voices to be heard and everyone’s say to be equal and drawing together the best of everyone’s ideas to reach a decision that everyone was happy with. This was tricky at times but meant that all decisions were collectively reached.

Also local groups (e.g. Yorkshire, West Midlands) got together to organise neighbourhoods. Before the 2006 camp these were mainly just organising to get a kitchen, shelter and people to the camp. After the camp some of them became local action groups, taking action against the causes of climate change locally as well as organising a neighbourhood for the 2007 camp.

The land on which both Camps were held was squatted. How was it occupied?

I wasn’t actually involved in this but in 2006 small groups of people (about 80 people in total) were transported to near the site and dropped off at different places. This was in the middle of the night. They then walked onto the site. A fence was erected and legal notices put up. A complex scaffold tripod was erected and some attached themselves to it so that eviction would be harder. A few marquees were erected. This was all done before about 6am. That all sounds quite simple but it took an awful lot of planning and organising, which had to be done in secret.

In 2007 a similar method was used. Small groups of people from different parts of the country got themselves to places near the site – transport was less of a problem in an urban location – then when the coast was clear walked onto the site and carried on as last year but with a simpler and quicker to set up fence and a spectacular double tripod which it seems was erected in seconds, well minutes. Both times it took the police a few hours to find the site, by which time infrastructure was well under way.

The focal points of the Camps were the “days of mass action”. What did these actions aim to achieve?

There were several aims in 2006. The first was to shut down one of the root causes of climate change: Drax coal fired power station. It seems crazy to try to shut down a power station but it’s much crazier to still be burning coal in such huge quantities so it’s a proportionate response. Secondly we wanted to get media attention to let people know just how crazy it is to be burning fossil fuels and that people are willing to take direct action to stop it. Thirdly the aim was to inspire people – who were on the action, at the camp or heard about it – to take direct action against the root causes of climate change. As well as being inspired people could also attend training and workshops and talk to each other so that they had more idea of how to take action. The aim was to build the growing network of climate change activists, and that people joining this network would come from lots of different backgrounds not just the ‘usual suspects’. This last aim seems the least tangible but you should never underestimate the potential of physically getting lots of people together in one place who share a common purpose, and then telling loads more people about it.

In 2007 the second and third aims were the same and were definitely expanded on – we got huge media attention and a lot more people got themselves clued up and joined the action. Also a dozen smaller actions took place around the same time as the mass action – BP, carbon offset companies, a nuclear power station and an airport owner were targeted by small affinity groups. The first aim was to disrupt Heathrow airport but by targeting the corporations – BA and BAA – not passengers. These corporations are pushing for airport expansion and a third runway in the full knowledge that this gives the UK zero chance of meeting even its 60% CO2 reduction targets., Basically they want to commit us to runaway climate change. So this year we wanted to tell BA and BAA exactly how appalling their actions are and support the ongoing local campaigns against airport noise, pollution and expansion by telling the whole world about the proposed third runway and the wider impact on climate change and all our lives.

Why and how was the decision made to target Heathrow airport in the first place?

The decision was made by a process of consensus decision-making at a gathering of about 100 people, one of the open public monthly meetings. Detailed information on six different locations was provided by the Land group who had spent months researching different potential sites.

How do you measure success or failure?

I don’t think you can. The camp was definitely a huge success both years in that we achieved our aims, but it’s so much more than that. For me there are many successes, small and large but all important. Just mobilising enough people to organise the camp was a huge success, as was each bit of positive media coverage we received or each person inspired.

I don’t think you can say that something as complex as Climate Camp was simply a success or a failure, and to do so is to completely detract from our whole ethos which is that there is no one solution to climate change, that people need to find new and various ways of working together, that we are trying out new ways of living, being, thinking and organising here. This is all about a complex, diverse, ever-changing way of behaving not about simple black and white choices between A or B. So there were multiple successes and lots of failures too, but I’d see these more as part of our learning and our experiment. Like some of the meetings at the camp were very difficult, people didn’t participate in a fair way and bad decisions were made. However, that is both a failure and a success if in the process lots of people learnt better how to conduct themselves in meetings to make them work well. You can only succeed or fail if you have set, concrete and immovable aims. Thankfully Climate Camp isn’t like that – if it was then it would be just another political party or ideology-based group.

This isn’t to say that we shouldn’t think about success or failure, of course we should, but that it would be dangerous and counterproductive to measure it in the terms it is usually measured in, say in the contexts of business or elections. It may make us sound like we’re fobbing off the person asking whether we succeeded or failed, but people need to start thinking in different ways if we are to change the world enough to escape the most devastating effects of climate change. It is up to us to demonstrate and live these different ways, and to inspire others to do the same by the way we act and what we say. For me the camp was a huge and ever-changing experiment in collective living which was incredibly exciting. We started off at this year’s set-up with maybe 150 people who were already used to DIY culture and working collectively, then every day more and more people arrived who weren’t used to that but started to learn about it, be inspired by it and consider how they could take it back into their homes, communities, workplaces and anywhere else they found themselves. This was incredible to be part of. Every day in the Welcome tent I met dozens of people for whom this was all completely new, and every day I saw someone who I’d welcomed yesterday taking part in consensus decision making, being a legal observer, cooking with others to feed 200…now that’s what I call a success!

The only thing I would be tempted to call a failure would be if the taking of the land hadn’t worked or we’d been evicted straight away, but even that wouldn’t have been a complete failure. It would be a failure in that the aim of taking a site wasn’t achieved, but so many of our other aims would have been achieved because a huge amount of people would already have been inspired and mobilised and we’d have run at least the workshops somewhere else. It was portrayed that not shutting down Drax was a failure, but again that’s only if you take a narrow view of what success and failure are. It wasn’t a failure to me – it would have been great if we had shut it down but the real impact and therefore success was still there in the money it cost them for security, the huge amount of adverse publicity and the fact that lots and lots of people really started to think about coal and why we really have to stop burning it.

Also, for me personally and for many others, we understood what direct action is all about and were inspired to support or carry it out ourselves. For me one of the biggest successes you can have when campaigning on any issue is to educate people – be it information, ideas, attitudes or behaviour. Every single person that has ever campaigned, protested, taken action or stood up to be counted was inspired and educated at some point which set them off on that path; whether through reading something, seeing something, hearing something or talking to someone. So, just getting our message and our ways of living, working and being out there was, to me, actually our biggest success.

Will there be a third Camp for Climate Action?

Who knows! There are regional meetings taking place through September for local groups and neighbourhoods to get back together and decide what they can do next. Then there will be a national gathering in October where everyone will decide what next. Anyone who comes can input into this. Lots of people assume there will be a third camp but there are lots of other ideas to consider too. Whatever happens though, this ever-growing movement for action on climate change is not going away. I can’t wait to be a part of what happens next…",2214,3.67,2.78,2.91,,,,,,,,,

As part of our dedication to resisting all forms of oppression, many of our members have put their lives on the line organizing against white nationalists, Nazis, and other reactionary scumbags. Be assured that any endorsement of fascism is and always will be grounds for dismissal from Deep Green Resistance, and that we consider the entire notion to be morally depraved and philosophically bankrupt.
These most recent accusations are dishonestly capitalizing on an interview one of our leaders, Derrick Jensen, did with Hubert Collins. Collins reached out to Derrick and asked for an interview, which Derrick gave. Unfortunately, Collins posted the interview on Counter Currents, a right-wing news website that hosts anti-feminist, conservative, and white nationalist content. Derrick was unaware of Collins’ views and disavowed him completely upon finding out. Nothing in the interview itself even hints at any fascist views or duplicitous motives. And if you don’t trust us, trust them – Collins himself prefaces the interview by saying that Derrick is an opponent of white supremacy and “surely hates everything about Counter Currents.” 
This is actually a fairly common problem with prominent leftist voices – Noam Chomsky, for example, once gave an interview to Hustler magazine without realizing it would be sandwiched in between vile pornography. Of course, the armchair activists attacking us are not receiving interview requests from anyone, so it stands to reason that they wouldn’t understand how things like this can happen. But happen they do, and only the most disingenuous and opportunistic trolls would see them as evidence of secret fascist sympathies. 
There is nothing new to these accusations, of course. We in Deep Green Resistance have been routinely smeared as fascists for years now. The reason why is simple: Because DGR proudly rejects the white-chauvinist, Eurocentric settler mindset of the modern American left. Most fundamentally, we are not a human supremacist organization. We believe that environmentalism exists to defend the health and freedom of the whole living world, of which human beings are merely a small (but precious!) part. Further, we believe that, when our way of living comes into conflict with the health of the land and the non-humans with which we share it, our way of living is what must go. 
For many people, these are upsetting statements; for those activists whose idea of liberation is tied up with air-conditioned subway cars and automated luxury goods, they can be downright terrifying! It’s no wonder, then, that so many techno-utopians are quick to assume that we support sterilization, eugenics, “population control,” or even mass killings or genocide. Nothing could be further from the truth, of course. All those things are both morally unacceptable and practically foolish. DGR advocates for the targeted abolition of industrial civilization, not indiscriminate destruction or mass extinction. To be honest, we find it particularly sad that so many “environmentalists” simply cannot imagine a biocentric worldview apart from these atrocities – but their lack of imagination is not our fault, and we’d appreciate it if they stopped making up nonsense.
Deep Green Resistance has also been accused of supporting nationalism, Trumpian border walls, and even white separatism. These are more ridiculous lies. No one in DGR approves of the Trump administration’s policies towards migrants, or those of any imperial politician. However, unlike many other American leftists, our hatred of colonial borders comes from the colonial part, as opposed to the blanket rejection of any and all restrictions on movement. We believe that the land belongs to its indigenous keepers, and that their historical and cultural ties to that land are to be celebrated, revered, and protected. We don’t believe that “the Earth belongs to everyone,” or that a perfect world would be one in which the children of colonizers are allowed “free movement” over the lands of the colonized. In our perfect world, settler-colonialism is abolished and what belongs to the indigenous is returned to the indigenous – not redistributed to the settler nation. 
Unfortunately, this is enough to have many anarchists and social ecologists – steeped as they are in the Manifest Destiny ideology and its pathological hatred of boundaries – to accuse us of closet fascism. Some have gone so far as to compare our defense of indigenous land ownership to the “Blood and Soil” politics of the National Socialists in Germany! The Eurocentric chauvinism required to conflate every possible form of national identity with the specific depravity of white supremacy is as dumbfounding as it is disgusting. We can only encourage these folks to look beyond 20th century European history for a change, as uncomfortable as that might make them. Hopefully, they would come to learn from indigenous notions of tribal, national, and ethnic identity that are distinct from Europe’s pathetic and vicious fixation on the colonial fantasy of race.
You may have heard the expression, “When you’re used to privilege, equality can feel like oppression.” Well, the settler-colonial left needs to learn that when you’re used to complete and total freedom, any boundary can feel like fascism. After all, prominent leftist heroes like Jean-Paul Sartre and Michel Foucault condemned the “police state” for preventing men from raping children. Other leftist figures in the United States denounced the Black Panthers and the American Indian movement as “bourgeois nationalists” for excluding whites. We in Deep Green Resistance are tired of this Eurocentric, patriarchal chauvinism, never moreso than when it is passed off as some sort of radical devotion to social justice. We will continue to organize as a radically anti-colonial, radically anti-patriarchal, radically anti-industrial – and yes, radically anti-fascist – movement. We encourage those who make a name for themselves smearing us to get off Facebook and Twitter for a moment and try to do the same.

Our story.

Extinction Rebellion is a global movement that uses non-violent civil disobedience in an attempt to halt mass extinction and minimise the risk of social collapse.

On 31st October 2018, British activists assembled on Parliament Square in London to announce a Declaration of Rebellion against the UK Government. The next few weeks were a whirlwind. Six thousand rebels converged on London to peacefully block five major bridges across the Thames. Trees were planted in the middle of Parliament Square, and hole was dug there to bury a coffin representing our future. Rebels super-glued themselves to the gates of Buckingham Palace as they read a letter to the Queen.

Extinction Rebellion was born.

The call to rebel swiftly became global, with groups popping up the following week in Europe, the US, and soon after the world over. Leaderless and truly global, each new group makes the movement stronger, bringing in new perspectives, wisdom, expertise, energy and inspiration.

Why rebel?
black and white drawing of an orchid
What you can do.
The time to act is now.

Traditional strategies like petitioning, lobbying, voting and protest have not worked due to the rooted interests of political and economic forces. Our approach is therefore one of non-violent, disruptive civil disobedience – a rebellion to bring about change, since all other means have failed.

Non-terrorist,Extinction Rebellion,4,0,0,USA,n/a,3,n/a,Leader,https://rebellion.global/why-rebel/,"Why rebel?
We are in the midst of a climate and ecological breakdown. We are facing an uncertain future - our world is in crisis and life itself is under threat. Now is not the time to ignore the issues; now is the time to act as if the truth is real. The science is clear. We are in the midst of a mass extinction of our own making and our governments are not doing enough to protect their citizens, our resources, our biodiversity, our planet, and our future.

This crisis knows no borders, race or ethnicity, and while wealth may offer some protection, it is all but temporary. The clock is ticking, and if we don’t succeed in uniting to protect our planet, everyone will be impacted - you, your family, everyone and everything you hold dear…

…and yet every crisis contains the possibility of transformation.

Here’s The Problem:
We’ve all heard it before - the Earth is getting hotter, CO2 levels are rising, and we are in the midst of the Sixth Mass Extinction (The Anthropocene Extinction). We are facing two equally critical issues - biodiversity loss and climate change. Both are having unprecedented dire consequences not only on us as humans, but on every living being and ecosystem on the planet. It is beyond a doubt that human activities are triggering these changes.













The Possibility of Transformation
We are standing on a precipice. We can acknowledge the truth of what we are facing, or we can continue to kick the can down the road and allow the effects of a heating planet to have even more detrimental outcomes on all living beings. We are already locked in to a certain amount of warming and biodiversity loss, but there is still time to change this story.




What Makes XR Different?
We are paving a different path. The world we want to live in requires a culture that is healthy, creative, resilient and adaptable. We are facing tough choices and so far, these catastrophes have been met with little effort from governments and institutions to change the trajectory we are on.










You are XR
Extinction Rebellion is made up of people from all walks of life, different backgrounds, cultures, and political affiliations - people like you, coming together to create a different story. We know the crisis we are facing, and we want to change the future. This fight is all of ours, and we all need to be willing to stand up for the truth and face it together.






Non-violent Civil Disobedience
With over 1169 groups in 76 countries, we are already making a difference. XR has been credited for compelling legislation, pushing governments to take action, and shifting the public discourse on the climate and ecological crisis through our creative, artful, sustained, non-violent protests all over the world.We follow in the footsteps of many who have come before us. From India’s Independence Movement to Women’s Suffrage, the Civil Rights Movement to the Arab Spring, history has shown us time and time again that nonviolent protest does work as a powerful means to bring about change.And yet, there are no guarantees. As rebels, we know that tomorrow’s reality is today’s concern. A world ravaged by climate change and biodiversity loss is one that will gravely affect us all.

Why Rebel
We have no other choice. We rebel against the systems that got us here. We rebel for the future we want. We rebel because it is our responsibility to act. We have no more time to waste. Nothing is impossible - we can still write the story we want and we will. We as individuals can make a difference, collectively. We will do this together - transform the world, create lasting change and build a better future for all.
